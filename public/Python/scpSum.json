requested and required to use any means up to and including: impersonation of a peace officer, intimidation, and threats/actual use of deadly force to retrieve the item., Addendum 342\\xa0C: Agent [NAME REDACTED]\\'s Report: Our first experiment with the ticket had a Class D personnel member enter onto a bus using the object.\\nAt the final point before the bus was to be parked for the night, we saw him pounding on the window with a pleading expression, screaming towards the agents for help as it pulled away, a strange mist filling much of the background behind him., As we could not draw many conclusions from this event, we decided to track down some of the passengers and interrogate them, to hopefully shed some light on what happened.\\nAgent Strahm reports that the guards appeared to be in a trance and attempted to separate him from the user, softly chanting, \"One at a time, please.\" Nevertheless, he managed to push his way through by force, although he was forced to knock down one officer who attempted to interpose himself between Agent Strahm and the door., On the train, the user became very quiet: surprising, as he was one of our most violent D-Class personnel.\\nAgent Strahm continued testing and interviewing until the prisoner said softly, \"Let me off this fucking train.\" Agent Strahm said that they could leave after a few more hours, at which point the user became insanely aggressive, and began jumping up and down, off the walls, and swinging on the bars and holders, while howling like a primate.\\nAfter the subject woke up, Agent Strahm made the decision to abort the experiment, and told the D-Class subject that he would help him get off the subway as soon as possible, if he cooperated.\\nHolding him tightly, they attempted to leave, but were prevented from doing so by the crowd., Agent Strahm attempted to exit a second time at the next stop, taking the precaution of holding up his badge and ordering all passengers to remain in their seats.\\nAgent Strahm reported that the prisoner was almost pulled away from him: he was unable to determine by what means, but claimed that \"the hands that pulled him back didn\\'t belong to any passengers.\" Fortunately, Agent Strahm had handcuffed himself to the subject, and was able to maintain contact with the D-Class personnel, although his attempt to exit the vehicle was unsuccessful.\\nNow in a state of panic, the prisoner clung to the agent like a frightened child so tightly that Strahm had bruise marks on his chest and arms for days, and screamed several times that the handcuffs were \"slipping off.\" In the chaos, Agent Strahm\\'s badge was knocked out out his hand, and he sustained a blow to the side of the head., During the ride to the third stop, Agent Strahm, in a highly aggravated manner, interrogated the new passengers to find out who had hit him.\\nGiven the extraordinary circumstances, the Board of Inquiry has chosen not to reprimand him for this lack of control., Agent Strahm made a third attempt to get the prisoner off the train, choosing to take a coordinated approach.\\nThey wake up and even though they slept for hours they still be on, who knows where\u2026\" He then stated his intent to cooperate and curled up in a fetal position, rocking slowly., At the next stop, Agents Macabyern, Cinulure, Smith, and Jacobs (accompanied by Dr. Gunsther, the project head) boarded the subway and began pushing their way through the crowd towards Agent Strahm and the subject.\\nSCP Foundation personnel, in the guise of Transit Authority officers, then evacuated the entire train, platform, and station of all civilians., Agents Strahm, Macabyern, Cinulure, and Smith, and Dr. Gunsther then attempted to lead the prisoner off the train.\\nAgent Strahm ceased his efforts after the prisoner was threatened with deadly force by Agent Smith, screaming at his fellow agents that, \"He\\'s not holding onto anything, there\\'s some kind of wall.\" Other agents appeared confused, claiming that the subject was maliciously attempting to impede exit by holding onto one of the supporting bars.\\nThey continued in this assertion until it was pointed out to them the impossibility that this could take place, given that both of the prisoner\\'s hands were being held by agents at that time., In a last, desperate effort to extract the subject, the personnel attempted to dismantle the subway around the user through the use of cutting torches and power tools.\\nAgent Strahm remained with the subject, while the others exited to help Foundation personnel prepare.\\nThe agents did not manage to catch up to it until the next stop, and passengers immediately filed on, despite their commands not to., Agent Strahm was later discovered lying on the subway platform 8 kilometers away in a comatose state.\\nTraces of blood found on the metal have been determined to belong to the subject., Addendum 342\\xa0E: Subway Experiment Three: Possibly due to mental trauma from his loss of Subject D-342-D, Agent Strahm volunteered to be the subject of the next experiment, stating that someone more knowledgeable of our terms and procedures could provide better communication.\\nFor this reason, this experiment was the most useful and rewarding, and a full log of the sequence of events experienced by Agent Strahm can be found in the attached documentation., Of particular note: Agent Strahm made no effort to leave the subway, or even consider the possibility of doing so.\\nThis acceptance of his fate may have allowed an avoidance of mental anguish, as seen in the following log:, It was at this point that a homeless man travelling on the train hurled Dr. Haber across the room and broke his neck, before being shot four times in the chest by Agent Erin.\\nThe vagrant died on the way to base, and although transported in a highly secure ambulance, his body disappeared when passing through an abandoned part of town, specifically under a ruin of a train bridge., Agent Erin ordered the train evacuated and stated his intention to continue the experiment alone, remaining with Strahm.\\nHallucinations continued as the trip progressed: Agent Erin reported seeing flickering shadows and strange phenomena, while Strahm reported more overt hallucinations, including Agent Erin\\'s face melting apart to reveal a horned red faced monster, and the very metals and materials of the train beginning to melt like wax and mold and reform strangely.\\nAccording to Agent Erin, shortly after reaching the end of the line, Agent Strahm began to slowly drift forward towards the front of the train, passing through solid material in the process.\\nWhen pointed out to Agent Strahm, Strahm became perturbed and began to run towards the back of the train.\\nAgent Erin attempted to halt Agent Strahm\\'s progress, but succeeded only in knocking him to the ground, at which point Strahm quickly accelerated towards the front of the train, sliding on his stomach.\\nAgent Strahm passed through the closed conductor\\'s compartment door and into the conductor\\'s compartment, where he immediately began to cry out in terror., Agent Erin stated, at this point, that he drew his service revolver and attempted a benevolent termination of Agent Strahm, but was unable to do so through the reinforced glass of the conductor\\'s compartment door.\\nHis last reported observation of Agent Strahm states that he saw \"a creature, kind of like an enormous spider, but wearing a conductor\\'s hat, looking up from the levers, wrapping Jerry in a web, like a cocoon, and then throwing him through the window, like it was air.\" The creature then turned towards Agent Erin and ordered him to exit the train, at which point Agent Erin lost consciousness from terror.\\nWe attempted numerous other iterations of the same concept: prisoners entering a company bus along with other agents, and we also each had a ticket present to gain entrance.\\nThis corpse was said to have entered the bus and sat down, which then pulled away, smoothly navigating the pileup before disappearing., We tried the same parameters (real vehicle,

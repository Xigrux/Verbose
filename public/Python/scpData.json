While [     ] is generally cordial and cooperative with Foundation staff, it can become especially irritated or at times outright aggressive if it feels that it is in the presence of what it calls the \"Pestilence\". Although the exact nature of this Pestilence is currently unknown to Foundation researchers, it does seem to be an issue of immense concern to [     ]., [     ] will become hostile with individuals it sees as being affected by the Pestilence, often having to be restrained should it encounter such. If left unchecked, [     ] will generally attempt to kill any such individual; [     ] is capable of causing all biological functions of an organism to cease through direct skin contact. How this occurs is currently unknown, and autopsies of [     ]'s victims have invariably been inconclusive.

Make no mistake, there is something very uncanny about this entity indeed., Additionally, we've confiscated that pointed stick that [     ] keeps waving around. Part of this was due to standard confiscation protocols for the possessions of anomalies, and part because 049 really is a menace swinging it around like he does. The entity was displeased at first, but after we made some concessions in providing it with \"test subjects\" (which are, admittedly, more for the benefit of our own research) it warmed up to the idea., Addendum 049.2: Observation Log, While in containment at Site-19, [     ] has spent a considerable amount of time studying and performing surgery on the various mammalian corpses it has been provided.

This continued for a period of several months, during which [     ] never exhibited any aggressive behaviours., On April 16th, 2017, as Dr. Hamm was entering [     ]'s test chamber to conduct another routine interview, the entity began to grow anxious and asked Dr. Hamm if he was feeling well. Following protocol, Dr. Hamm reminded [     ] that the interview was required, after which the entity became hostile and attacked Dr. Hamm, killing him. Due to a lapse in security protocol, and because Dr. Hamm did not activate the in-chamber emergency system, Dr. Hamm's corpse was not discovered until three hours later, by which point [     ] had converted it into an instance of [     ]-2., In the aftermath of this incident, [     ] was interviewed by Dr. Theron Sherman., , "

It is noted that despite the grainy feel of [     ], it does not mark the mirror in any fashion while moving across it., Two mirrors at either end of a standard-grade table: [     ] gravitates toward the closer mirror regardless of orientation and makes no distinction between different types of mirrors, favoring a factor of distance above all else in choosing the mirror to move to., A mirror held by a person and moved around: [     ] follows the mirror as it moves, gaining speed until a maximum velocity of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is reached. At any velocity, the impact of [     ] against a mirrored surface results in no damage to either object., A person holding [     ] placing it on a mirror: This test was accidental, the result of one of the staff tripping another after some debate about who would be covering the lunch tab.

The surface of [     ] consists of a thin, transparent membrane similar to that of an animal cell roughly .5\u00a0cm thick, and is highly elastic, allowing [     ] to flatten portions of its body up to 2\u00a0cm thin. This surface is also hydrophobic, although [     ] can willfully absorb liquids (see Addendum [     ]-A). The rest of [     ]'s body is filled with a viscous orange substance of unknown chemical makeup, though it is capable of digesting organic materials with ease., Subject\u2019s temperament is best described as playful and dog-like: when approached, [     ] will often react with overwhelming elation, slithering over to the nearest person and leaping upon them, \u201chugging\u201d them with a pair of pseudopods while nuzzling the person\u2019s face with a third pseudopod, all the while emitting high-pitched gurgling and cooing noises.

Upon depositing fifty cents US currency into the coin slot, the user is prompted to enter the name of any liquid using the touchpad. Upon doing so, a standard 12-ounce paper drinking cup is placed and the liquid indicated is poured. Ninety-seven initial test runs were performed (including requests for water, coffee, beer, and soda, non-consumable liquids such as sulfuric acid, wiper fluid, and motor oil, as well as substances that do not usually exist in liquid state, such as nitrogen, iron and glass) and each one returned a success. Test runs with solid materials such as diamond have failed, however, as it appears that [     ] can only deliver substances that can exist in liquid state., It is of note that after approximately fifty uses, the machine would not respond to further requests. After a period of approximately 90 minutes, the machine seemed to have restocked itself. It is also interesting to note that many caustic liquids that would have eaten through a normal paper cup seemed to have no effect on the cups dispensed by the machine., Testing is ongoing. As suggested, [     ] was moved to the 2nd floor personnel break room as a money-saving venture. Following incident 294-01, guards were stationed at the item and a security clearance became necessary to interact with it., Document [     ]a (regarding incident 294-01): On August 21, 2005, Agent Joseph \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 attempted to use Item [     ] to obtain coffee during his allotted break time at 9:30 AM.

A containment procedure breach had occurred exactly the same time this test was taking place, waking [     ] to its active stage.

Researcher requested similar precious materials with the same result., Addendum [[     ]j]: Researcher punched in (from a safe range) request for \"cup of anti-water\". The machine hummed briefly, then displayed \"OUT OF RANGE\" on entry pad. It is theorized that [     ] has a limited range of collection, and cannot reach into alternate universes/dimensions., Addendum [[     ]k]: Researcher punched in request for \"diamond\". [     ] briefly hummed, then displayed \"OUT OF RANGE\" on entry pad. [     ] gives this result for all solid substances. As diamond is a solid crystalline form of carbon, it appears the machine will not dispense liquid carbon, as this does not result in a \"diamond\".

In his briefing, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 confirmed that his favorite drink ever was a Vienna lager he consumed at the beach with his friends. It has now been confirmed that [     ] has the ability to directly gather information from someone's mind in order to comply with the given conditions., Addendum [[     ]q-01]: Subject keyed \"the perfect drink.\" The machine dispensed a cup containing an odorless lavender liquid. After drinking the liquid, subject appeared to go into shock. Subject later committed suicide, leaving a note which read \"I'm sorry, but at this point everything's just one big letdown.\" Requesting such a drink again is highly discouraged. None of the components of the drink have yet been identified., Addendum [[     ]t-01]: Subject keyed in \"something Cassy will like\". The device was heard to hum for about three seconds, before dispensing an empty cup. Printed on the side of the cup was an image of a traditional soda fountain glass, filled with something brown, and topped with whipped cream. Upon introduction to [     ], it was identified by her as a chocolate banana milkshake and judged 'delicious'., Addendum [[     ]w]: Researcher keyed in request for \"a cup of music\". [     ] produced a clear, sparkling fluid that tasted vaguely alcoholic. Following ingestion, subject reported \"feeling\" and not hearing, a continuous rhythm, and demonstrated the ability to move and even dance with a certain fluidity that he had not previously shown. Testing on other abstract concepts is continuing., Addendum [[     ]ab]: During a mass security breach, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 requested \"a cup of pertinent medical knowledge\" while taking shelter inside the second floor break room. Of the four agents in the room, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was the only one who was not injured. [     ] poured a cup of clear green liquid. Following the ingestion of this substance, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began mending the other agents' wounds in a manner consistent with Foundation medical training. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 no longer has the medical training that the liquid provided and other attempts to recreate the effect have failed. The agent has speculated that this event was an emergency measure taken by the object to ensure self-preservation., Addendum [[     ]ac]: Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 requested \"my life story\" from [     ]; [     ] made humming noises and shook violently for approximately 3 minutes before providing a highly viscous, opaque black liquid. Upon consumption, Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that he remembered everything that had ever happened to him. Following this test, Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 entered his office and returned 48 hours later with a 538-page autobiography., Addendum [[     ]ad]: Researcher produced request consisting solely of the phrase \"surprise me\". Device produced an opaque cup containing normal water, later determined to have been heated to approximately 200 degrees Celsius. Upon receiving vibration from transport, the contents of the cup turned into steam, violently spraying boiling water in a 2-meter radius., Addendum [[     ]af]: Researcher produced request for \"Blood of Christ\". [     ] vibrated and produced the message \"Hic est enim Calix S\u00e1nguinis mei\", then produced a paper drinking cup containing approximately 0.12 liters of red grape wine., Addendum [[     ]ag]: Researcher produced requests for \"cup of Smilodon blood\", \"cup of passenger pigeon blood\", and \"cup of Thomas Jefferson's blood\", and received three \"OUT OF RANGE\" errors., Addendum [[     ]ah]: A D-class personnel with IQ of 99 and low curiosity scores was given written instructions about what to request. The D-class personnel produced a request for 'blood of canis lupus' and received a cup of liquid subsequently identified as wolf blood. The D-class personnel next produced a request for 'saliva of equus ferus caballus' and received a cup of liquid subsequently identified as horse saliva. The D-class personnel next produced a request for \"urine of phascolarctos cinereus' and received a cup of liquid subsequently identified as koala urine. The D-class personnel next produced a request for \"cerebrospinal fluid of phoberomys pattersoni\" and received a cup of liquid currently undergoing analysis. It is to be noted that Phoberomys pattersoni went extinct during the late Miocene epoch, approximately 8 million years ago., Addendum [[     ]ai]: Dr. King produced request for \"a cup of room-temperature superconductor\", and received a cup of apple juice with seeds floating in it., "

Adults range in size from 1.5 to 3\u00a0m (5 to 10 ft) in height, and weigh between 90 and 270\u00a0kg (200 - 600 lbs). They have grey, brown, black, red, and occasionally white fur. They possess large eyes with good vision, a pronounced brow ridge, and a sagittal crest on the forehead similar to that of the gorilla, but present in both sexes. Their intelligence is on par with that of Pan troglodytes (the common chimpanzee)., [     ] evolved alongside Homo sapiens, existing contemporaneously with proto-humans and humans in large numbers until 10,000-15,000 years ago, when an extinction event eliminated all but 1-5% of their population. This event was triggered by [     ] contracting an anomalous \"pseudo-disease\" classified as [     ]-f1. This disease is passed on at the genetic level and affects every present-day instance of [     ]. The majority of [     ] instances are born immune to the effect; those who are not born immune quickly die., The effect of [     ]-f1 is as follows: Any hominid (including humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and non-immune instances of [     ]) that directly or indirectly observes any instance of [     ] has a minimum 2% chance of being instantly killed through anomalous means via permanent cessation of brain function. This percentage is cumulative, and the longer a human views [     ], the higher the chance of instantaneous death increases, at a rate of +1% chance per 20 minutes of viewing. This effect varies between individual members of [     ]'s species, with some individuals carrying a 'death chance' of 90%. The effect is also produced by dead individuals, though small fur samples do not exhibit the effect., Known means of preventing this effect are small-scale only and include [REDACTED] (see attached documentation; Level 3 clearance required)., Because of [     ]'s close relation to humanity, it is considered likely that [     ]-f1 could eventually transfer to human carriers. Any instance of [     ] finding its way to a major population center could constitute an \u2588\u2588-class end of the world scenario with a minimum death toll of [REDACTED] and possible extinction of humanity. Fortunately, [     ] appears to instinctively avoid human contact., It is not currently feasible to exterminate [     ] entirely., The highest known population concentrations of [     ] are at present located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and the Himalayan Mountain range in Asia. As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, these populations remain extant. [     ]'s presence and [DATA EXPUNGED] have also been documented within the past 5 years on every continent. All known significant populations of [     ] located near human population centers have been eliminated., [     ] came to the attention of the Foundation via contact by Doctor Franz M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in 14\u2588\u2588 with the Children of the Sun, who identified themselves as outcast members of the Serpent's Hand. This group has since been completely destroyed by the Foundation, due to their reluctance to surrender information about [     ], SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 (since reclassified as [     ]-\u2588\u2588\u2588 and [     ]-\u2588\u2588\u2588). Remaining members have either joined the Foundation, or have gone into hiding, presumably as members of the Serpent's Hand. Weapons, tools, and other unique pseudo-technological resources in possession of the organization have been classified as [     ]-001 through [     ]-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. These resources have been made use of by the Foundation in multiple instances; for a full list, see Document 1000-3534-Y (Level 3 clearance required). Access to surviving ex-members of the Children of the Sun is restricted to personnel with clearance level 4/1000 unless given direct authorization for contact by Director Jones., Further information is available to personnel with clearance level 3/1000 or above. Personnel with clearance level 3/1000 or above are required to read Document Alpha-1596-1000., Addendum 1000-466-X: Update to Special Containment Procedures: As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, [     ]'s Special Containment Procedures no longer include Procedure 516-Lumina.

Whether [     ] resistance to Procedure 516-Lumina was calculated (and as such may be a sign of [     ] [REDACTED]) or coincidental (by chance of natural species variation) is not known at this time., Document Alpha-1596-1000: Missive from Director Jones, Addendum 1000-056-D: Instances of [     ] have tried to make contact with Foundation personnel on multiple occasions.

Performances of the play are associated with sudden psychotic and suicidal behavior among both observers and participants, as well as the manifestation of a mysterious figure, classified as [     ]-1. Historical estimates place the number of lives claimed by the play at between \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 over the past three hundred years., Performances of The Hanged King's Tragedy do not always end with an outbreak. Of the \u2588\u2588 recorded performances, only \u2588\u2588 (36.78%) have ended in [     ] events. According to historical records and investigations, these outbreaks generally follow the same pattern:, For a typical case study of an outbreak, see Incident Report [     ]-19\u2588\u2588-1, an analysis of the events leading up to the last uncontained [     ] event in 19\u2588\u2588, during a high school drama performance in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Despite our best efforts to the contrary, however, the play remains freely available online, sometimes under different titles. All attempts to detect or isolate the origin of these copies have failed. Suppression of the play's publication has generally been successful, with most copies of a 1971 scholarly edition destroyed before distribution. Nonetheless, copies of the 1965 trade paperback turn up with some regularity in both college and high school libraries. Agents are to obtain or otherwise destroy these items whenever possible., History: The first known publication of The Hanged King\u2019s Tragedy was as a quarto dated 1640. The play\u2019s author is not listed. The publisher, one William Cooke, disappeared from the historical record soon thereafter. Strangely, the text does not appear in the Stationers\u2019 Register., The first known [     ] event on record occurred in 18\u2588\u2588 during a performance of the play in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, USA.

Through testing, composition of the subject revealed no unusual qualities that make it discernible from a non-sapient teddy bear. Subject is capable of moving of its own accord, and can communicate through a small range of gestures. The subject regularly shows affection to individuals in ways found endearing by most people. Affection is usually given in the form of a hug to the lower leg, but subject has also been observed dancing, jumping in place, and in two separate events it has even drawn child-like pictures for janitorial staff. All Foundation personnel that have interacted with the subject have responded positively to its affection, even D-class with normally sociopathic tendencies., Attempts at direct communication with [     ] have not been considered successful. Though it is capable of simple gestures to indicate a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, it will often not react to lines of questioning concerning its nature or where it originated from. It is not known if this is because [     ] simply does not know the answers, or because it does not want to answer. Though capable of drawing pictures, it has not used its art as a form of communication beyond showing affection, even when encouraged to do so., The more anomalous behavior of [     ] was not observed until approximately 7 months after it was originally secured. It is hypothesized that the subject is able to construct crude replicas of itself using various materials, by a process that has yet to be observed directly by Foundation staff. Dr. Carver has suggested that [     ] uses its endearing qualities to lull those around it in to a false sense of security, allowing it to collect materials to produce these creations. Currently, there are 3 known creations of [     ], designated [     ]-A, [     ]-B, and [     ]-C. The nature of these creations has been in stark contrast to [     ]'s general behavior, as all have exhibited extreme violence towards humans., [     ]-A: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, [     ]-A was discovered wandering Site 24, accompanied by [     ]. Subject resembles a teddy bear similar in size and shape to [     ], but is made entirely out of human ears. Witnesses interviewed reported that it appeared [     ] was giving a \"tour\" of Site 24 to [     ]-A. Dr. Carver was called to the scene, along with a security team. The security team arrived first, and attempted to contain [     ]-A. Subject emitted a high-pitched shriek that inflicted intense pain in the eyes and ears of everyone in a 10 meter radius. Ear-like growths immediately began growing on those within 5 meters of the subject, covering their bodies in less than 20 seconds. Every person afflicted with this symptom died within 3 minutes, resulting in the death of \u2588\u2588 personnel, including the entire security team. Autopsies revealed the cause of death to be asphyxiation caused by an abundance of the ear-like growths manifesting in the mouths and tracheae of all victims. [     ] and [     ]-A fled the scene before Dr. Carver arrived, and have not been contained since the incident, though sightings of both have been reported on multiple occasions. Shortly after this incident occurred, a researcher was discovered missing an ear. According to him, it was removed through unknown means while he was sleeping. No other victims of ear removal were found, so it is unclear if [     ] obtained more ears from another source, or if it is capable of duplicating objects or materials., [     ]-B: Subject was discovered by several Foundation staff members in the cafeteria of Site 24 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Subject's appearance was nearly identical to [     ], but it moved in an irregular, jerky manner. Witnesses reported that it appeared as if something was moving inside of [     ]-B. Subject made no attempt to interact initially, until a burst in its seams revealed what appeared to be the hand and arm of a human infant poking out and grasping at the air. At the sight of this, a female researcher named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 screamed, and [     ]-B reacted by emitting a high-pitched cry similar to that of a human infant. The subject then attempted to [DATA EXPUNGED] the screaming researcher, causing massive internal damage. In the ensuing chaos, a security team was forced to [REDACTED] both the researcher and [     ]-B. Approximately 3 hours after this incident, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was found unconscious and bleeding in her office. An abortion had been performed on her while she was sleeping, and the 8-month-old fetus was never found. It is hypothesized that [     ] used Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's unborn child to create [     ]-B. Information regarding the possible origin of [     ]-B is not to be leaked to the survivors currently undergoing therapy for the incident with [     ]-B, as Dr. Carver believes it would be extremely detrimental to their recovery., [     ]-C: Subject resembles a teddy bear similar to [     ], but composed entirely of rusted metal scraps. Subject was first sighted on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 by Dr. Carver in his office while writing up a report on the [     ]-B incident. Subject fled the room when it noticed Dr. Carver observing it. In the attempted pursuit of [     ]-C, Dr. Carver witnessed the death and maiming of \u2588 Foundation personnel as the subject exhibited extreme violence during its escape. [     ]-C has not been encountered since this initial sighting, and it is unknown whether it still resides somewhere within Site 24. The origins of any materials possibly used to construct [     ]-C by [     ] are also unknown at this time., Addendum 1048-1: [     ] is similar, but nearly antithetical in function, to [     ].

Anything coming into contact with this substance slowly decays over a period of time, depending on the material, until it has decayed completely into a pool of the original contaminant. Glass seems to react the slowest to the effects of the item, hence the construction choice of its immediate container. Living organisms that come into contact with the substance react much the same way, with no chance of recovery. Origin of the liquid is unknown.

Insurrection failed.

Several personnel have protested against this, with some even erupting into violence. As a direct result, all personnel that have come into contact with [     ] have been terminated. Going forward, all personnel that deal with [     ] are to be rotated frequently, and contact is to be limited even to its dormant state to as little as possible., Addendum 035-06: Personnel within 10 meters of [     ] have recently reported feeling unease, stating that they can hear unintelligible whispering.

Tests on the substance have revealed it to be human blood, although highly contaminated with several foreign and unknown agents. Substance is corrosive, having a pH of 4.5, and prolonged exposure to the walls has proven to be detrimental to their structural integrity., More notably, it seems to be forming patterns on the walls. Several segments seem to be paragraphs in various languages, including Italian, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. Translation is pending. Other segments appear to be diagrams depicting ritualistic sacrifice and mutilation, often for the arcane benefit of the person committing them. Several staff members have been shocked to note that all of the sacrifices bear an uncanny resemblance to various personnel and their loved ones, often in conflicting positions., Researchers while in the room examining these newly formed patterns have complained of hearing loud whispering, and high pitched, unnerving laughter at irregular intervals., Personnel in the section working daily near and around [     ]'s containment unit have suffered catastrophic morale damage, with an all time high in suicide rates in staff in that area, whether or not they have ever had contact with [     ]., The only change in [     ]'s dormant behavior is regarding its contained glass case. Degradation of the case has increased to a high degree, enough so that the glass will occasionally shatter, causing a wide dispersal of [     ]'s contaminant. This occurs quite often at the most inopportune times, so far resulting in six (6) casualties and three (3) fatalities of both research and cleanup staff., Addendum 035-08: In light of the mass suicide/homicide of the members of the research team tasked with translating the passages garnered from [     ]'s containment cell, the morale damage in the area, and general loss of staff dealing with [     ] to either death or insanity, it has been decided to coat the inner and outer walls of its containment cell with [     ], which has proved well in the containment of [     ] (see Document 132-01), in order to hopefully block out the high levels of negativity being emitted by [     ]., Addendum 035-09: The use of [     ] has worked well, causing morale and suicide rates to return to near pre-[     ] rates., However, the material appears to facilitate the negativity within the cell, causing a veritable \"Greenhouse Effect\" inside. Personnel inside the cell have stated that they feel a heavy sense of dread, fear, anger, and general depression, as well as hearing constant, nearly inaudible whispering upon immediate entry. A prolonged stay causes severe migraines, suicidal tendencies, heavy hemorrhaging of blood vessels around the eyes and inside the mouth and nose, general hostility to others, and for the whispering to increase to almost deafening volumes, intersected by a constant mocking laughter. Exposure of more than three (3) hours inevitably results in the subject falling into a deep psychosis, and attempting to harm either themselves or others. Most spoke in Latin or Greek, despite the fact that several did not previously know how to speak said languages beforehand., The presence of blood in both word and diagram formations has increased disproportionately, the walls becoming cluttered, and the formations beginning to overlap each other.

General estimation gives the current walls a life of two (2) months before they will need replacement., It is becoming gradually more and more difficult to contain [     ], and the debate to reinstate its host privileges has once again come up. (Denied), Addendum 035-10: The walls, ceiling and floor of [     ]'s containment cell have now been completely saturated in blood.

These reports consisted primarily of disappearances of farmers in the region and were not considered until the local police, followed by the regional police, and finally a government dispatched agent all failed to report in within a 72 hour period. A small military contingent was dispatched to the area and quickly withdrew at which point The Foundation was contacted to investigate., The area [     ] affects is close to Lake Baikal in Southern Siberia. Areas of known infection are marked on a map provided to us here. Containment perimeters are marked in blue surrounding these infection areas and as of present no further locations have been identified. Incursions into the perimeter must be reported prior to conducting, confirmed during exploration, and debriefed on immediately following return., [     ] appears to be a contagious skin disease at first with symptoms including rash, itching, and increased skin sensitivity. Within 3 hours the disease will cause blemishes resembling heavy scar tissue to form in the chest and arm areas, spreading to the legs and back within an additional hour, consuming the victim completely within five hours. Exposure to higher temperatures vastly decreases the time for the contagion to spread and complete infections have been recorded occurring in as little as five minutes., After the completion of the infection occurs the victim's life functions will cease for approximately 3 minutes after which time they will restart at 2-3 times the activity rate of a normal human. Following this, the scar tissue on the victims will start to move of its own accord and grow at a rapid rate. Normal human features start to disappear at this point under the infection and the path of mutation appears to be largely random. Subjects observed in this stage of infection have been recorded as growing three or more limbs of a type such as arms or legs, the head may become misshapen and elongate or widen out, and parts of the subject may split open from which additional branches of flesh will grow. The duration of this stage of infection is unknown and not all subjects appear to progress to the later stages., Under unknown conditions an infected individual will cease moving and place itself in a location it deems suitable where it roots itself. The fleshy growth on the victim will then begin to spread itself across all surrounding objects and consume them. Such objects do not spread the infection as living creatures do, however, and the effect of prolonged contact with these objects is recorded later in this document. It is assumed that this behavior is to create an area hospitable to continued growth of the other infected., Observation of life infected by [     ] by staff is impossible. Those infected with the disease immediately seek out aid as natural human impulse resulting in unintended infections. Those infected past the scar tissue phase actively and aggressively attempt to infect anyone approaching them within an undefined area. It has been established that should an infected be capable of sight and observe an uninfected, it will proceed toward them. If the infected has lost the ability of sight, a range of approximately 30 meters is considered safe., Observation of [     ] infected settlements has been established using artificial methods such as remote robots. The data returned from these observations coupled with the openly aggressive nature of the infected to attempt to spread [     ] has resulted in the Keter classification, however so long as nothing is allowed to enter or leave the infected areas it is considered a neutralized threat. Of concern are the cavernous areas beneath the infected settlements that were discovered during the exploration and attempts to get research personnel into these areas are underway., "

Careful examination reveals there are far more pages between the bindings than could be contained within them., Readers admit to feelings of paranoia, unease, and occasional nausea while reading [     ], although this may be related to the subject material. Nonetheless, readers almost universally describe [     ] as fascinating and express continued interest, despite its frequently unsettling content. One in fifteen readers describe [     ] as having a faint odor of dried blood., [     ] is a detailed account of an ancient civilization originating in what is now south-central Siberia, identified as the Daevites. Although like all cultures the Daevites evolved and changed over time, they appear to have exhibited unusual continuity. Universal fixtures of the Daevite culture in all periods included militarism, conquest, ancestor worship, urban centers ruling over large slave populations, gruesome human sacrifice, and the practice of apparently efficacious thaumaturgic rituals. A variety of relics and creatures produced by the Daevite culture would be abnormal or dangerous enough, if the account is to be believed, to qualify for containment in their own right., If [     ] comes into contact with any fluid suitable for writing, including human blood, the account of the Daevite civilization\u2019s history expands. Human blood appears the most \u201cpotent\u201d of possible writing substances, but in any case the amount of new material does not correspond proportionately to the fluids introduced. Although these new segments sometimes include new descriptions of rituals or cultural traits or illustrations of previously covered material, they more frequently include new, more recent accounts of information chronicling the continued history of the Daevite civilization or descriptions of new individuals and artifacts. Formerly decisive defeats become setbacks; new persons and events are inserted. Foundation archaeologists have discovered corresponding new artifacts and traces of the Daevite civilization in applicable locations and strata, in some cases found in dig sites that had already been thoroughly explored., Although at times the Daevites were a collection of city-states, they appear to have consistently returned to imperialism under a theocratic aristocracy (the \u201cdaeva\u201d), practitioners of cannibalism and thaumaturgy. Although initially Foundation researchers believed the daeva to have been a hereditary class recycling the names of noteworthy individuals, evidence and the events of \u2588-\u2588\u2588-20\u2588\u2588 now suggest that the daeva possessed preternatural longevity as a result of [REDACTED]. Several researchers, notably Professor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, have concluded the daeva were so divergent from modern humans as to be a separate subspecies, a conclusion supported by graphic representations within [     ] and [DATA EXPUNGED]., [     ] is remarkably detailed by the standards of a primary source, seeming closer to a biography than a historic text. It includes lurid descriptions of sacrificial rites, battlefield descriptions, daily life, and the life stories of various noteworthy individuals including quotes and dates of birth. Over \u2588\u2588\u2588 distinct individuals have been identified including the individual presently termed [     ]-A, of which only \u2588\u2588 are accounted for by recorded deaths., Foundation archaeologists have discovered several sites containing ruins consistent with the supposed Daevite culture in various locations across Siberia, northern Iran, and Mongolia. Artifacts and traces of inter-cultural conflict and contact have been discovered as far west as the Carpathian Mountains and as far east as northern Pakistan and China.

Please see capture logs for SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for further details., The front door of [     ]-1, when opened, appears to contain a spatial anomaly. Neither matter nor light has been observed to exit the doorway, save for instances of [     ]-2 (though the anomaly is exothermic)., [     ]-1 is accessible through other entrances, including windows, the back door, and entrances cut into the back of [     ]-1. However, the front room does not appear to exist inside of [     ]-1. Doors that should lead to the front room instead lead to other doors inside the building. Measurements of the inside and outside of [     ]-1 are inconsistent. Holes cut through the interior walls of [     ]-1 that should lead to the front room lead instead to the outside walls around the front of [     ]-1, but stop three meters on either side of the doorway. Attempts to drill into the front room of [     ]-1 from the outside have led to the exposure of smaller portions of the anomaly, though instances of [     ]-2 have not been observed to exit them. Further attempts to breach the wall have been forbidden by O5-03, due to the possibility of allowing increased potential for instances of [     ]-2 to appear., [     ]-2 are bipedal creatures approximately 1.8 meters tall. They are vaguely humanoid, and entirely black in color. They are highly aggressive and will engage any human on sight. When an instance of [     ]-2 comes into contact with a human, they extend an upper limb into the human's chest cavity, without any apparent damage to skin or tissues. Through unknown means, they then extract the heart, killing the human. Once it has acquired a human heart, the instance of [     ]-2 will return to [     ]-1., Silver munitions fired while offering prayer is the only known method of killing [     ]-2. The precise form of the prayer or religion of the supplicant does not appear to matter, so long as the prayer is sincere. Once killed, the bodies of [     ]-2 appear to \"disintegrate,\" leaving a small layer of sulfur., [     ] was discovered after a series of mysterious deaths in the vicinity of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 County. Foundation investigators encountered instances of [     ]-2 and were able to trace them back to [     ]-1., Addendum 1: A team from MTF Chi-13 was sent through the front doorway to attempt to investigate the anomaly. They did not return. However, shortly after they entered, the front door appeared, closing in the frame. No further manifestations of [     ]-2 appeared., Addendum 2: A second assault team entered [     ]-1 to determine the fate of the first assault team. They did not return. The door did not close. Shortly after new manifestations of [     ]-2 appeared, Agent Morris entered the doorway, which closed shortly after., "

        "text": " [     ] is an unlabeled, green hardcover book with no apparent exceptional qualities. When [     ] is opened, it displays the phrase \u201cA hero is born\u201d on the first page viewed, while all other pages will be blank, \"resetting\" once the book is closed. This has no obvious effects at first, but upon falling asleep, the reader will dream of a fantasy world where they are the protagonist of a troubled land. Dreamers are completely aware and all senses work just as well as when awake. Results vary depending on the imagination of the reader and are mostly attuned to fantasies of adventure that the reader would enjoy. In the mind of the reader, these dreams have been documented to last anywhere from 45 seconds (see Experiment 1230-3) to 200 years (see Experiment 1230-5) but in reality, the reader will usually never be asleep longer than they would normally. Upon awaking, the reader is able to remember every aspect of their dream in detail. In [     ]-induced dreams, there is always a character called the \u201cBook Keeper\u201d ([     ]-1) appearing as a bearded man in a green cloak who claims to be the personification of [     ] himself. [     ]-1 has been reported to be very amicable and helpful towards dreamers. It has stated that it enjoys creating these \u201cfantasy-scapes\u201d and always tries to shape them in such a way that the dreamer garners the most entertainment out of it. It has expressed sorrow when the dream comes to an end and asks the dreamer to \u201cplease visit again soon\u201d., Discovery: In a small bookstore located [DATA EXPUNGED] the shopkeeper had no recollection of owning the unlabeled book but attempted to sell a story to local newspapers about a \u201cmagical dream book\u201d. The Foundation was able to dispel the story as a hoax and [     ] was confiscated., Experiment-1230-01: Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, in an attempt to test its effective range, opened [     ] and boarded a flight to his hometown of [REDACTED] where he spent the night at a hotel. Upon his return, Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that [     ]-1 appeared in his dreams and explained that once you read \u2018A hero is born\u2019, the dream is immediately implanted in your subconscious, after which [     ]-1 is able to manipulate it remotely. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 expressed his appreciation for [     ]-1\u2019s cooperation., Experiment-1230-02: A camera was set-up above [     ] and, using a mechanical \u201carm\u201d, the book was opened. All pages were revealed to be blank. It seems [     ] is only effective when opened by beings that are able to have dreams. [     ]-1 explained to a subsequent dreamer that it is actually only able to affect beings \u201cwith an imagination\u201d and that most creatures such as animals would not be affected., Experiment-1230-03: One (1) D-class was instructed to open the book and (after much reassurance that his experiences would only be dreams) ordered to immediately find a way to kill himself in the dream. The subject was asleep for merely 45 seconds before he awoke with a start in a nervous sweat. He reported being at the summit of a volcano called \u201cThe Ashen Spire\u201d on a quest for \u201cCaladius, the Blessed Blade\u201d. When asked how the subject knew the names, he stated, \u201cIt\u2019s like I knew them all along\u201d. He apparently leapt into the volcano and \u201cfelt an intense heat\u201d before awakening. D-class requested permission to \"give it another go\". Request was denied., Experiment-1230-04: One (1) D-class was instructed to open the book and attempt to non-fatally injure himself in his dream. After 6 hours, the D-class awoke and reported that he was able to feel a \u201cnumbed\u201d sort of pain where it was never so intense as to be unbearable. He also reported meeting an elderly, cloaked man who asked him why he was harming himself, but thanked him for not immediately killing himself \u201clike that other rude fellow\u201d., Experiment-1230-05: Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 filed a request for access to [     ] and was quickly permitted, given his Level 4 clearance. Staff members recalled that Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was almost \u201cvisibly shaking with excitement\u201d and some reported that Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was an avid fan of tabletop and role-playing games. Surveillance shows that Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 opened the book, read the phrase, sat down beside the desk and promptly fell asleep. Staff members were alarmed when Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 did not awake after 15 hours and alerted security. The on-site medical staff were able to confirm that Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was still alive and in good health. After approximately 24 hours since falling asleep, Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began to move, reported to have \"slowly raised his head and looked around the room, appearing deeply confused\". Security entered the room to ensure he was alright, to which he replied, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d. He was sent to Medical where staff explained where and who he was. Several minutes later, Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appeared to have regained his memory and excused himself to the restroom. When 15 minutes passed and Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had not exited, a nurse entered to find he had hung himself with his belt. A scribbled message on the wall revealed his last words: \u201cI can\u2019t go back to this\u201d. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 went to ask [     ]-1 what had happened, but upon opening [     ], all its pages were soaking wet with the same message on every page: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I never intended for this to happen. I just wanted to make people happy.\u201d repeated over and over. [     ] remained in this state for three weeks and its desk had to be wiped dry biweekly. In an attempt to communicate, Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 placed a sticky note inside [     ] with the statement, \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you, if that\u2019s alright\u201d. The next morning, Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 filed a report about a dream he had concerning [     ]-1., Shortly after the report was filed, surveillance showed Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 slipping another small paper into [     ]. A few days later, [     ] began showing its usual \u201cA hero is born\u201d greeting once again. When asked what the note said, Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 declined to give detailed comment, simply stating that he \"just gave it some friendly advice\"., "

The exact nature of this pattern has not yet been successfully analyzed, and [     ] has not been able to provide any information concerning it. The subject is not actively hostile and will not resist attempts to contain it, though all such attempts have failed and led to a considerable loss of personnel and resources due to the aforementioned anomalous properties., [     ] was first brought to the Foundation's attention when it approached Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a researcher at Site-\u2588\u2588, on her commute to work.

The front cover bears the title \"Star Signals\". The back cover has the following description:, When a subject reads the full text of [     ], the book exerts a mild reality-warping effect, influenced by the subject's desires (which in turn are influenced by [     ]; see below). When a sufficiently large number of subjects are exposed to this effect, further complications arise in terms of mental health and the integrity of spacetime. See Event Log [     ]-05., The document is a nonfiction book of the \u201cself-help\u201d genre, advertised as a manual which teaches the use of the \u201cFive-Step Star Signal Method\u201d to achieve the reader\u2019s dreams and ambitions. The method itself is a program of visualization reinforced through mantras and positive affirmations. Unlike nearly all books of the \u201cself-help\u201d genre, [     ] is directly efficacious in assisting the subject in achieving personal goals. The book has no content regarding practical measures to achieve goals. Instead, it speaks entirely on the \u201cstar focuses\u201d and other \u201cwishful thinking\u201d rituals. These exercises, when conducted properly, demonstrably influence reality, beginning with a direct influence on the appearance of the star used in the exercise. A reader who expresses a wish to win the lottery will receive a winning ticket within the next week; any reader whose goal is a new car will find themselves driving it the next week. The amount of work invested into achieving the goal outside of performing the prescribed rituals has only a supplementary effect; a subject who makes no special effort to pursue the focused desire still succeeds at a rate documented at roughly 80%. However, if the instructions for reading order and frequency are not followed correctly, the anomalous effect is either greatly diminished or fails entirely., In early chapters, these exercises are focused on two things: the exact goals that the reader has in mind, and the concentration on certain stars in the sky. This activity is connected to the titular \u201cstar signals\u201d: [     ] claims that the light emitted by stars carries a \u201cphenomenological frequency\u201d, which is unique to each star and which is connected to the \u201cphenomenological frequency\u201d of each human\u2019s mind. Each of the book\u2019s ten chapters ends with a \u201cStar Focus\u201d ritual: this is a meditation performed each night, with the central focus being a celestial body. The celestial body used is determined by a calendar given in the prologue; this ensures that all readers at any given time are focusing on the same place, no matter which section of the book they are reading. The tenth chapter is an exception. See Document 1425-A., Throughout its pages, [     ] contains verbal devices intended to influence the mind of the reader during exercises. These include the combination of memetic triggers and neuro-linguistic programming to make the subject receptive to the ideas presented in the text and to optimize the results of its anomalous effect. Once the core ideas of the book have been introduced and worked upon, visualization exercises begin to include concentration on other concepts, including political and philosophical messages. The latter chapters of the book serve to alter the thoughts and desires of the user to conform to a standard that would remain consistent across readers of the text. Approximately 60% of readers who read the entirety of [     ] exhibit a mental condition called \u201cOjai Syndrome\u201d; see "

If 963-1 is removed after this time period, the subject retains an independent copy of the consciousness of Jack Bright. Sanctions were put in place to prevent multiple instances of Dr. Bright from being created to prevent Dr. Bright from collaborating with himself, however it was found this was not necessary, as Doctor Bright has proven thoroughly dedicated to the Foundation and its cause., Doctor Bright himself has performed extensive experimentation on [     ]-1, with the expressed desire for release from it. Interviews with Doctor Bright indicate that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 killed himself in the process of empowering [     ]-1, and was therefore never able to slave his own consciousness to the amulet. Doctor Bright hypothesizes that he accidentally activated 963-1's power by being killed, instead of killing himself as the original creator had done., "

Each face of the figure has a circular hole in the center, and a small sphere is attached to each vertex. [     ] is made of an unknown, but highly magnetic, alloy about as hard as brass., When inside an enclosed structure, [     ] expands the structure's inner dimensions without altering its outer dimensions. [     ] will increase the inner dimensions of any enclosed structure by several hundred meters each day, beginning one hour after entry into the structure. Initially, [     ] only extends the walls out, causing rooms to become much larger without adjusting the height of the room. This expansion continues until the original dimensions of the room have been tripled., At this point, [     ] starts creating wholly new rooms. [     ] is apparently able to copy items from inside the structure, creating furnished rooms consistent with the rest of the structure. After a period of time, however, the expansion process appears to break down. For example, items will be made from inappropriate materials (glass books, a wooden microwave), rooms will be oddly-shaped, doors will open into blank walls, and hallways will be tiny or twist back around in long mazes. The new inside structures continue to be more and more odd, while the outside remains unchanged., This behavior is most dramatically illustrated in homes; however, it has been observed in other instances, including a cardboard box. The changes do not go away with the removal of [     ], but no additional structures are created., Addendum 184 - 1: Notes from Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I don\u2019t think I need to stress the fact that this thing can NEVER be allowed into Site-19. We may need to look into different containment at some point, but for the time being, we will keep it in the open, immovable, and hidden., Addendum 184 - 2 Locations of Interest, It is currently hypothesized that [     ] or an anomaly with a similar effect may be responsible for the creation of Locations of Interest such as Backdoor SoHo, and Ch\u016bgoku Cellar. Investigation into [     ] as a potential origin for these spaces is ongoing., Addendum 184 \u2013 38RB: Notes on recovery, [     ] was recovered in the Kowloon Walled City in June of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Reports of the city's bizarre and explosive growth attracted Operatives, who soon learned of [     ], held in the possession of [DATA EXPUNGED]. After several police crackdowns, Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 was dispatched and recovered [     ] with minimal losses. The final effect of exposure to [     ] on both the City and inhabitants may never fully be understood due to the reckless actions of local law enforcement, which destroyed several affected sections of the city before Operatives could take action to prevent it., Interviews with residents yielded minimal information, with a communal \u201cwall of silence\u201d being the major response. A few documents indicated that [     ] could be brought into a home and allowed to affect the dwelling for 50 pounds sterling per half hour. These documents were unconfirmed by residents., "

According to their testimony, they found a set of rusted keys in an iron lockbox and determined what door the keys unlock.

Other parts of [     ]-CAS01's body are found scattered as far as 32\u00a0km from the factory. Under interrogation, the apprehended juveniles tell authorities that upon opening the door with one of the keys, [     ]-CAS01 was torn into several pieces, each of which disappeared. At this point, the SCP Foundation takes over the investigation., 07/04/1949: SCP Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 obtains the keys from the local authorities to begin testing. Tests show that [     ]-2 through [     ]-13 all fit into a single lock on the large barred door. 12 Class D personnel are assigned to test the effects of the door. Of the twelve test subjects each trying a different key to enter the room, only two survive. Opening the door with any key except [     ]-7 or [     ]-12 caused the test subjects to be torn apart in multiple directions; however, no dismembered parts were found until later. At the time of writing, only two parts of each subject have been recovered (with the exception of the subject using [     ]-\u2588, whose pieces were scattered in close proximity). The others have, for all intents and purposes, vanished from existence., Of the two surviving subjects, only one (having used [     ]-7) returned unharmed. The other came back in a near-catatonic state, able only to remove himself from the room and then collapse on the floor, and had to be restrained to prevent him from gouging out his eyes (see Appendix A: Mental Health Effects of [     ]). The subject using [     ]-7 said that he had entered a large room, impossibly big for the size of the attached building. After his exit, [     ]-1 was propped open and an armed squad of Level 3 personnel entered. The size of the room is impossible to measure and the door frame and the individuals in the room are the only part of the room that can be felt or illuminated., 07/16/1949: The juvenile suspects and Sheriff \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are terminated., 08/02/1949: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is declared a hazardous area \"due to unexploded ordnance\" and fences erected in order to prevent civilian ingress.

Testing is suspended until further notice., 07/02/19\u2588\u2588: The unaccounted-for remains of [     ]-CAS01 appear unexpectedly outside [     ]-1. Despite being killed decades before, the remains of [     ]-CAS01 are not decomposed in any manner and are still warm to the touch. Blood remains uncoagulated. The remains are remanded for testing., 07/04/19\u2588\u2588: The unaccounted-for remains of one of the twelve (12) original test subjects appear in similar manner to those of [     ]-CAS01.

Records suggest that both [     ]-CAS01 and CAS02 used [     ]-\u2588\u2588., 03/21/1999: With the massive proliferation of nuclear weapons and World War III only \u2588\u2588 years away, construction has begun on a site inside [     ]-1. The site is to stock supplies for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 person-days., 04/21/1999: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has ordered the site inside [     ]-1 to be expanded to include emergency storage for all mobile SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 specimens and a \u2588\u2588-petabyte database for the storage of all SCP data. The facility is now referred to as Site-62., 09/25/2000: Site-62 is operational. Labs and containment units are complete and can contain the most dangerous specimens. Backup of the SCP database has begun., 01/25/2001: Due to time anomalies (see \u201cSpace-Time Anomalies\u201d below), all personnel working at Site-62 are now required to reside on-site permanently. Families of personnel are to be informed that loved ones perished in an industrial accident. Cloned bodies have been prepared for funeral., 08/14/2003: Massive power outage across Northeast United States and through Canada. Due to the initial failure of multiple SCP generators, Site-62 was without power for fifty-three (53) minutes. During those fifty-three (53) minutes, those on site were completely without any source of light. They reported \"sensing\" creatures and people, although no abnormal entities could be seen or felt.

Personnel leaving the facility report losing time. Those who have been in the site for weeks insist that they had only been in the facility for several days, and records of work completed and supplies consumed support their claims. Other temporal anomalies involve [     ]-2 through -13, especially the reappearance of [     ]-CAS01 and [     ]-CAS02 exactly \u2588\u2588 years after using [     ]-\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been assigned to investigate all aspects of these time anomalies. Spatial anomalies include the impossibly large dimensions of the area opened by [     ]-7. Similarly, the 2003 blackout incident suggests that there exists an alternate plane of existence within the same space that Site-62 occupies., Testing on [     ] reveals that ten of the keys open [     ]-1 on a dimension where the laws of physics and topology are significantly different than those of our home dimension. Test subjects meeting these hostile conditions are torn apart, their body parts deposited in various locations, only three of which have been verified to be on Earth. Material deposited at two of these points appears immediately; material deposited at the third appears exactly \u2588\u2588 years into the future. The other seven locations are currently unknown., Current testing focuses on two avenues of research. The first is finding ways to survive [     ]\u2019s hostile topologies. The second [DATA EXPUNGED] suggest that [     ]-2 through -13 may open doors other than [     ]-1., All Class D personnel using [     ]-12 return in a catatonic state, unable to speak. Some may have enough energy left to try to claw out their eyes. Of the 16 subjects, only 4 have survived. Only one has regained speech, following long-term psychotherapy. He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a massive green creature, so large that much of its body extended beyond his field of view. He reported innate fear and sudden recognition, \u201cas if it were something buried deep in [his] primal fears,\u201d and forced implantation of \u201cincomprehensible\u201d memories. Subject displays acute anterograde and retrograde amnesia., Item #: [     ]-14, Date of Discovery: 09/02/1950, Origin of Object: Object was discovered elsewhere in factory area, in the previously undiscovered manager's office., "

Arms, legs, spinal cord, and shoulder blades of the subject appear to have been replaced with artificial versions of unknown make and metal. Subject only takes notice of this when it is pointed out, and states that it has no knowledge of how, why, or when these replacements took place, stating it had had them as long as it could remember. There is a symbol engraved into the forehead of the subject, which appears to be of Sumerian origin. Symbol has of yet been untranslated, and subject appears distressed when the symbol is mentioned at all, refusing to speak on it. Subject does need to eat and drink on a regular basis, but is strictly carnivorous owing to its effect on plant-based items., [     ], who refers to itself as \"Cain\", is generally polite and genial to all who speak to it, though it has been described as being cold and somewhat mechanical in its speech. It is very helpful, and enjoys aiding personnel in their daily actions, whatever they may be. It has highly detailed knowledge of ancient to recent events in history, and most commonly spoken languages in the world, including ones that have since died out. Subject has professed to having a photographic memory, remembering word-for-word all text in an eight-hundred-page dictionary that was flicked through in a minute and a half. It has scored above average in all intelligence tests given to it., [     ]'s presence is inimical to any and all life grown in soil, causing death to any such life within a twenty (20) meter radius. Any land [     ] has walked on (and any within the twenty [20] meter radius) becomes barren as all anaerobic bacteria dies, rendering the soil incapable of supporting life until new bacteria are introduced. Anything that is derived from soil-grown life, such as wood and paper, immediately rots and disintegrates upon touch of [     ]. Further affected derivatives include anything hydroponically grown., Violence directed towards [     ] reflects any damage inflicted on [     ] directly back onto the attacker, although [     ] visibly remains unharmed. This applies to any damage directed at [     ]. Attempts to get tissue and blood samples have proven futile: when the procedure was initiated, personnel carrying out the action felt the sensation of whatever was applied to [     ], and wound up with a sample of their own blood or tissue, despite the fact that ''all actions were directed solely at [     ]''. Indirect damage through a medium also results in the person perpetrating the action receiving the wounds caused. Although [     ] receives no actual harm from damage to its person, it has stated that it still feels the pain of the action, and has politely asked researchers to abstain from overly harmful actions to its person., Additional Notes: [     ] was found in the New York Police Department in 19\u2588\u2588, having been taken in after subject had been found amidst the bodies of several violent gang members. [     ] told police members that the gang had attempted to make sport of it, but became angry and attempted to kill [     ], resulting in their own demise.

The wooden portions of [     ] are made of oak, and the nails are made of steel., [     ] is capable of teleportation, being capable of moving its entire mass instantaneously between two points without any known limit. [     ] usually uses this to bring its constituent parts together when parts of [     ] have been removed from the mass, but [     ] can teleport its entire mass at once, on at least one occasion at a distance of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 kilometres. [     ] is capable of splitting its mass, though it does this rarely. Any amount of material removed from [     ]\u2019s mass continues to display [     ]\u2019s properties. [     ] has resisted all attempts to remove it from the confines of Storage Site-08, teleporting back to the site of its own accord. However, it has previously teleported out of Storage Site-08 for brief periods before returning, although this has only happened on \u2588 occasions since its arrival in Foundation custody., [     ] appears to be in some way sentient, as research indicates it is able to perceive its environment in a manner that is currently poorly understood, and is able to react to stimuli in an intelligent fashion. Details of [     ]\u2019s behaviour are poorly understood, although it has been ascertained that it will react in self-preservation, and will react aggressively to certain stimuli which it connects with a threat to its existence. Aside from this, [     ] appears to prefer situations in which it is utilised by humans, and will actively seek out situations where it can be put to use if it is left idle. This is the reason for the Foundation\u2019s present use of [     ] as mulch, as this prevents [     ] from becoming idle and attempting to leave Storage Site-08. It is theorised that [     ] is capable of understanding human speech or thought, although this cannot be determined as it does not comply with tests designed to gauge its awareness of such stimuli., When exposed to a number of specific stimuli, [     ] will react violently. During a typical violent reaction from [     ], it will teleport a portion of its mass inside the lungs of nearby personnel, causing immediate and severe lacerations to the interior of the lungs, as well as pulmonary obstruction, which rapidly leads to the victim\u2019s death. Stimuli which can instigate a violent reaction from [     ] include: personnel wearing the uniform of, or clothes similar to the uniform of, personnel affiliated with the Global Occult Coalition; utterance of words or phrases used heavily or exclusively by GOC operatives, such as \u2018threat entity\u2019, while in contact with [     ]; any action demonstrating hostility towards [     ]; and the sound of a running motor. Violent responses from [     ] are rare \u2014 only \u2588 such events have occurred since containment, and [     ] quickly reverts to a passive state after such a response if it does not continue to feel threatened., [     ] arrived in Foundation custody on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, after teleporting into an unused containment cell at Storage Site-08 in its current state. Careful investigation has revealed that [     ] was originally a large chair made of varnished oak and bleached leather, carved in the form of a reclining woman in a restful state. [     ] appears to have possessed its anomalous properties in this state, albeit with certain limitations, namely that the object would only teleport when a person within a certain radius (currently unknown) felt the need to sit down or rest without a comfortable seat or chair nearby. At this point, [     ] would teleport to them and remain in place until another person experienced a similar urge., On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, both Foundation operatives and members of the Global Occult Coalition were made aware of the existence of [     ], which was given the temporary designation of E-622. Due to the hard-to-contain nature of [     ] and the possibility of its existence causing a breach of secrecy regarding the existence of supernatural phenomena, a small-scale effort to contain [     ] was launched by GOC forces., It is presently unknown how exactly GOC operatives captured [     ], but it is known that they succeeded in reducing the object into its current form using a woodchipper. Further attempts to destroy [     ] failed, due to its properties and ability to teleport away from sources of danger. Following this event, several members of the Global Occult Coalition died under unusual circumstances. Investigation through both official channels and embedded Foundation agents within the GOC has potentially linked [     ] to at least three deaths of personnel within the Coalition, although the true number of casualties amassed due to their mishandling of the item is unknown. [     ] then arrived in Foundation custody. It is unknown how [     ] was aware of the existence of the Foundation, although it is theorised that it entered Foundation custody due to a low risk of further damage to itself., "

Part of the music appears to be an excerpt of Cavatina from the String Quartet No. 13 in B flat, Opus 130 by Beethoven. The encoded images vary greatly in content, but all contain physical or chemical information on the subject (e.g. size, mass and orbital period of a planet), and a string of pictorial characters., A radially symmetric organism (referred to as [     ]-3) is shown in various stages of development. Fully grown, the organism is approximately 2\u00a0m tall, and has three legs and three elongated arms, with each hand having three fingers, positioned around a central axis on a roughly cylindrical torso. Three snout-like protrusions exist in place of a head, each ending in a beak. 82% of the encoded images show [     ]-3 in a wide variety of presumed cultural settings. Scenes identified include agriculture, manufacturing, urban crowds and the playing of music on a string-and-bow instrument., Images of a number of celestial bodies are also included, such as a Venusian-type world with high atmospheric pressure and a star matching Gliese 445's stellar spectra. One planet shown has a partially Earth-like surface consisting of approximately 60% liquid water, 4% urbanisation and plant life and 36% apparent desert and wasteland. The planet has larger than expected storms and icecaps than would be suggested by physical quantities supplied by [     ]-2, and appears to be undergoing massive ecological collapse. An outline of a specimen of [     ]-3 is shown next to this planet., This planet is shown to have extensive orbital infrastructure, not limited to spacecraft manufacturing facilities, captured asteroid mining operations and space elevators grounded near urbanised and wasteland areas. All of these images show the structures to be in a wrecked or neglected state. The final encoded image shows a vessel heading towards an extremely damaged torus-style space station with a 2\u00a0km diameter aperture at its centre., "

SCP Foundation personnel are requested and required to use any means up to and including: impersonation of a peace officer, intimidation, and threats/actual use of deadly force to retrieve the item., Addendum 342\u00a0C: Agent [NAME REDACTED]'s Report: Our first experiment with the ticket had a Class D personnel member enter onto a bus using the object. We stationed agents at each of the stops to observe his behavior without actually entering onto the vehicle (a precaution in case everyone who got on was in some way affected; the old reports were vague in this area). Many times he simply sat in place, or paced up and down the aisles. Increasingly he began to stare outside in horror, and the last few times we could not locate him. At the final point before the bus was to be parked for the night, we saw him pounding on the window with a pleading expression, screaming towards the agents for help as it pulled away, a strange mist filling much of the background behind him., As we could not draw many conclusions from this event, we decided to track down some of the passengers and interrogate them, to hopefully shed some light on what happened. Many were hesitant to talk or claimed that they did not notice anything, saying they were preoccupied by something or distracted by illness, aches, or feelings of foreboding. We finally found some useful information from three boys (one 15-year-old (Caucasian) and two 16-year-olds (Hispanic)) who were riding the bus near the front for part of the trip. We were told that our test subject had tried to leave several times, but his pulling on the stop bell was always ignored, and the doors seemed to close right before he could get out. He would run and just not make it, or walk from a distance and get manipulated into the back of the line. Finally he sat right at the head of the bus so he could be close enough to get out in time, but every chance he got, there were too many people swarming on or off for him to leave., Something about this event seemed to bother the boys. One of them was particularly irritated, but could not explain the source. Under hypnosis, he described what to him was a moment of pure dread, that he had seen a few people in the crowd of passengers actually push the man back on, subtly hold him back, or trip him, all while staring ahead innocently, like they didn't even notice that they were doing it. Finally, after shouting at the driver that he wanted to get off for a good ten minutes (which the driver ignored, aside from requesting that the subject sit still and be quiet), the man went back to his seat, apparently giving up in despair. Two of the boys said that the man actually shrieked and stumbled back to his seat in fright when the driver turned around at him. The other didn't realize that the two were in conflict, which is contrary to his usual habit of avidly looking for and watching fights on the particularly rough inner-city buses., After going back to his seat, the boys said they promptly forgot about the subject, most likely because he was not struggling anymore. The next time they saw him he was three seats back, then five, then seven, but at no point could they recall seeing him stand up from his seat to move further back. This was all they could tell us, and it seemed to cost them plenty to even reveal this., On a side note: at the end of our session, the youngest teen screamed, \"It was like it swallowed him in the end!\" and promptly had to be hospitalized for extreme psychosis., Addendum 342 D: Subway Experiment Two: NOTE BY SUPERVISING OFFICER: Subway Experiment Two was the first time we had an observer alongside the passenger. Agent Strahm paid attention to the smallest details of the Class D personnel's behavior, took various fluid samples, and tested organs, mostly the heart and brain, until the man became too aggressive to examine. He also recorded an excellent log of all subjective and objective events. Since the physical examinations provided no special signs, except that the subject was in the midst of a typical nervous breakdown, said information has been placed in Document 342-D Alpha. Only the most relevant information has been included here., The two men bought passage, the prisoner presenting the ticket. Immediately, he became aggravated and said to the person accepting his ticket, \"What did you say to me, bitch? Are you threatening me?\" He was quickly hurried along to avoid an incident, and was almost immediately separated from the agent accompanying him by a pair of security guards. Agent Strahm reports that the guards appeared to be in a trance and attempted to separate him from the user, softly chanting, \"One at a time, please.\" Nevertheless, he managed to push his way through by force, although he was forced to knock down one officer who attempted to interpose himself between Agent Strahm and the door., On the train, the user became very quiet: surprising, as he was one of our most violent D-Class personnel. Agent Strahm continued testing and interviewing until the prisoner said softly, \"Let me off this fucking train.\" Agent Strahm said that they could leave after a few more hours, at which point the user became insanely aggressive, and began jumping up and down, off the walls, and swinging on the bars and holders, while howling like a primate. Agent Strahm knocked him out with a blow to the head from his truncheon and handcuffed him to a pole. To assuage civilian fears, he held up a badge that said he was a U.S. Marshal and went back to his analysis., Physical analysis indicated that the prisoner had entered a REM sleep state after only three minutes, which is especially unusual in a subject who had been knocked unconscious. After the subject woke up, Agent Strahm made the decision to abort the experiment, and told the D-Class subject that he would help him get off the subway as soon as possible, if he cooperated. Holding him tightly, they attempted to leave, but were prevented from doing so by the crowd., Agent Strahm attempted to exit a second time at the next stop, taking the precaution of holding up his badge and ordering all passengers to remain in their seats. Nonetheless, he was prevented from exiting the vehicle by the crowd boarding the train. Agent Strahm reported that the prisoner was almost pulled away from him: he was unable to determine by what means, but claimed that \"the hands that pulled him back didn't belong to any passengers.\" Fortunately, Agent Strahm had handcuffed himself to the subject, and was able to maintain contact with the D-Class personnel, although his attempt to exit the vehicle was unsuccessful. Now in a state of panic, the prisoner clung to the agent like a frightened child so tightly that Strahm had bruise marks on his chest and arms for days, and screamed several times that the handcuffs were \"slipping off.\" In the chaos, Agent Strahm's badge was knocked out out his hand, and he sustained a blow to the side of the head., During the ride to the third stop, Agent Strahm, in a highly aggravated manner, interrogated the new passengers to find out who had hit him. No one would give him any hint or clues, and many became hysterical at the merest question or touch. One woman began wailing when Agent Strahm grabbed her shoulder, although she was later silenced when he began shaking her vigorously. Security cameras record Agent Strahm throwing a male passenger to the floor and striking another in the face while the D-Class personnel wept and clung to his leg. Given the extraordinary circumstances, the Board of Inquiry has chosen not to reprimand him for this lack of control., Agent Strahm made a third attempt to get the prisoner off the train, choosing to take a coordinated approach. Using his radio, he communicated with agents at the next stop, despite difficulty due to static interference. Unusually, both sides said they heard the person talk in a quiet small voice like a frightened child, although both sides reported that they were using raised voices to be heard over the static., It was at this point that the prisoner began beating on the door screaming to be let off the vehicle. Agent Strahm, although sympathetic, warned the user that he would sedate him if he continued. This seemed to dismay the prisoner more than anything else: according to Agent Strahm, he stated, \"No, that's how it started. A lonely dark ride in unknown parts of the country. Travelers and drifters. The unattached. They would fall asleep, with a bottle of booze and oh god, when they woke up they'd still be going. Still be on. Don't you get it? They wake up and even though they slept for hours they still be on, who knows where\u2026\" He then stated his intent to cooperate and curled up in a fetal position, rocking slowly., At the next stop, Agents Macabyern, Cinulure, Smith, and Jacobs (accompanied by Dr. Gunsther, the project head) boarded the subway and began pushing their way through the crowd towards Agent Strahm and the subject. Despite efforts to intimidate the crowd, progress was difficult until Agent Smith fired his weapon into the ceiling and threatened deadly force. The subway car was evacuated of all other passengers and a protective cordon was placed around the subject. Agent Jacobs ordered the driver to shut down the subway; when the driver appeared confused, he ordered that all power to the subway be cut off. SCP Foundation personnel, in the guise of Transit Authority officers, then evacuated the entire train, platform, and station of all civilians., Agents Strahm, Macabyern, Cinulure, and Smith, and Dr. Gunsther then attempted to lead the prisoner off the train. Despite all efforts to lead, cajole, and force him off the train, no efforts were successful. Agent Strahm ceased his efforts after the prisoner was threatened with deadly force by Agent Smith, screaming at his fellow agents that, \"He's not holding onto anything, there's some kind of wall.\" Other agents appeared confused, claiming that the subject was maliciously attempting to impede exit by holding onto one of the supporting bars. They continued in this assertion until it was pointed out to them the impossibility that this could take place, given that both of the prisoner's hands were being held by agents at that time., In a last, desperate effort to extract the subject, the personnel attempted to dismantle the subway around the user through the use of cutting torches and power tools. Agent Strahm remained with the subject, while the others exited to help Foundation personnel prepare. While the equipment was being set up and everyone's backs were turned, the doors closed, and the train immediately started up and pulled away of its own accord. The agents did not manage to catch up to it until the next stop, and passengers immediately filed on, despite their commands not to., Agent Strahm was later discovered lying on the subway platform 8 kilometers away in a comatose state. One end of his handcuffs was still attached to his own wrist, but the other was empty. Traces of blood found on the metal have been determined to belong to the subject., Addendum 342\u00a0E: Subway Experiment Three: Possibly due to mental trauma from his loss of Subject D-342-D, Agent Strahm volunteered to be the subject of the next experiment, stating that someone more knowledgeable of our terms and procedures could provide better communication. O5-07 approved this after much pleading from Agent Strahm. Agent Erin and Dr. Haber, both close friends of Agent Strahm, accompanied him on his trip., The ride on the subway started out normally enough, although Dr. Haber noticed that Agents Erin and Strahm appeared to share a closer understanding of the phenomena experienced by Strahm, perhaps as a result of their close friendship. Agent Erin's empathy allowed Agent Strahm to remain coherent and sane for the entire length of the ride, and was able to calmly and rationally talk about seemingly otherworldly events without breakdown of linguistic and mental functions. For this reason, this experiment was the most useful and rewarding, and a full log of the sequence of events experienced by Agent Strahm can be found in the attached documentation., Of particular note: Agent Strahm made no effort to leave the subway, or even consider the possibility of doing so. This acceptance of his fate may have allowed an avoidance of mental anguish, as seen in the following log:, It was at this point that a homeless man travelling on the train hurled Dr. Haber across the room and broke his neck, before being shot four times in the chest by Agent Erin. Foundation personnel waiting at the next platform quickly evacuated them from the train on stretchers. The vagrant died on the way to base, and although transported in a highly secure ambulance, his body disappeared when passing through an abandoned part of town, specifically under a ruin of a train bridge., Agent Erin ordered the train evacuated and stated his intention to continue the experiment alone, remaining with Strahm. Hallucinations continued as the trip progressed: Agent Erin reported seeing flickering shadows and strange phenomena, while Strahm reported more overt hallucinations, including Agent Erin's face melting apart to reveal a horned red faced monster, and the very metals and materials of the train beginning to melt like wax and mold and reform strangely. Erin said he found it extremely difficult to think logically or concentrate, but he persevered to stay attached and talking to a increasingly deranged Strahm., This experiment has led to the formation of the idea that the user travels on two separate trains: the first, the four-dimensional vehicle of reality, and the second, a so-called \"shadow train\" that overlaps the first. Both trains move at the same rate, with passengers and personnel perceiving one or the other to various degrees, until the \"real\" train reaches the end of the line and stops moving, while the \"shadow train\" continues. According to Agent Erin, shortly after reaching the end of the line, Agent Strahm began to slowly drift forward towards the front of the train, passing through solid material in the process. When pointed out to Agent Strahm, Strahm became perturbed and began to run towards the back of the train. Upon reaching the mid-point of the third to last car, Strahm began to pound his fist against the air, stating that he was at the end of the train, and \"it's moving, it's pulling out of the station,\" and that he was unable to proceed further. Agent Erin attempted to halt Agent Strahm's progress, but succeeded only in knocking him to the ground, at which point Strahm quickly accelerated towards the front of the train, sliding on his stomach. Fingernail marks were later found in the carpet, where he had clawed at the ground in an attempt to halt his progress. Agent Strahm passed through the closed conductor's compartment door and into the conductor's compartment, where he immediately began to cry out in terror., Agent Erin stated, at this point, that he drew his service revolver and attempted a benevolent termination of Agent Strahm, but was unable to do so through the reinforced glass of the conductor's compartment door. His last reported observation of Agent Strahm states that he saw \"a creature, kind of like an enormous spider, but wearing a conductor's hat, looking up from the levers, wrapping Jerry in a web, like a cocoon, and then throwing him through the window, like it was air.\" The creature then turned towards Agent Erin and ordered him to exit the train, at which point Agent Erin lost consciousness from terror. He was later found huddled at the back of the train car with an empty weapon, continuing to pull the trigger on an empty cylinder over and over until the weapon was confiscated from him by personnel., Addendum 342\u00a0F: Doctor Gunsther's Supplemental Report: We set up several situations to try and discover the controls, parameters, and triggers of [     ]. First, we used a company bus and a driver that worked for our organization, and had the prisoner as the only passenger. Nothing happened, even though the ticket was ripped before entering onto the vehicle. We attempted numerous other iterations of the same concept: prisoners entering a company bus along with other agents, and we also each had a ticket present to gain entrance. We had them speak of this loudly and obviously, and even denied one agent entrance because he did not have a ticket. Still, the object did not change to resemble a ticket for the fictional transportation system we created., Next we had unaware citizens entering onto our bus, using tickets we had previously distributed. Once again, the ticket did not change, and our rider was able to leave at any time. We then exchanged our company bus driver for drivers hired from newspaper want ads. The drivers seemed confident at first, and were very excited about the prospects we were offering them, but when the prisoner came aboard (either on a empty bus or a full one), the driver suddenly became very bewildered and overwhelmed, saying that the controls for our bus were too advanced or new to him, he didn't understand the dashboard, he was \"more comfortable with his own bus,\" and couldn't drive this one, even if the same model bus was used. Attempts to refresh the driver's memories as to the method of operating the bus failed further, until even the steering wheel was considered \"too complicated.\", After this failure, it was determined to allow the drivers use their own buses. Making deals with the corporations and public departments, in the guise of a higher level government bureaucracy, we had them set aside a special time when they would only pick up the prisoner and when they would stop. Although the bosses were fine with this, when the moment came, the drivers refused to change their routine \"for egg headed paper pushers.\" All of them continued on the preset pathways, saying they were too busy or didn't have the time of day to go different routes just because someone ordered them to., Finally, we made a deal with a driver named Bucky Folsworth that he would pick up our passenger along his normal route, and would only switch with another driver (one of our personnel) halfway through. Driver Folsworth was offered considerable compensation, was told that failure to cooperate would result in his termination from employment, was instructed to constantly be in contact with us via radio, and to stop at the fifth stop, park the vehicle, and let one of our agents get on to drive. In hindsight, we realized that perhaps the ticket was luring us closer and closer to this edge, by presenting situations that were so close yet did nothing, in hopes of having us go just one more alteration further, until we crossed the line and allowed it to become fully active., When the prisoner neared the bus stop, the ticket turned to resemble a ticket to that specific vehicle. After realizing that this would be another doomed ride, several members of our team cautioned restraint and suggested we should send an Agent to accompany the prisoner. The consensus was we did not want to jeopardize a fragile situation that could suddenly fail at the slightest touch. I will admit a personal failing, as I was tantalized by the prospect of having one of our own be in control of the phenomena, and the vitally important data that could be gathered., Unfortunately, our giddiness and desire not to mess with a very important, perhaps once in a lifetime chance, only damned another person. When the bus driver reached the fifth stop, he halted the vehicle as instructed. However, as he attempted to leave his seat, the brakes on the vehicle failed, allowing the bus to speed down the hill, crushing a little girl crossing the street under its wheels. At first we thought this was an attempt by [     ] to lash out against us, at having outwitted it and kept the prisoner out of its grasp. Shortly afterwards, we realized that the important fact was not that the child was killed, but that the bus was still moving, and Driver Folsworth was still in command of the vehicle., We tried to get into communication with Bucky but he refused to talk. We thought maybe this was because he felt guilty for the death of the child and was worried he was going to be punished, so we tried to reassure him that if he stopped now, there would be no repercussions. At this we got the first word from him, a simple \"No.\" We knew then that we would have to use physical force to halt the bus. Setting up roadblocks and tire treads, we punctured two of the tires, and temporarily managed to tip it over on its side. However, he still somehow managed to go onto the highway and at one point we lost him when he went under the road. When he was found again, he was speeding, going at least 130 miles per hour in the middle of traffic in the opposite direction. At this point, he was a danger to the entire populace, not just the prisoner., We told local law enforcement to stand down, and chased after him with cars and helicopters. The last statement we got from him was, \"I'm not pulling over. I'm a driver and that's what I do. That's my purpose. I don't need to switch. I can get him where he's going!\" After this, he shot off the freeway into open space for about 10 seconds, before crashing into another lower lane. We don't know if this was intentional or not, as at the same time he veered towards the sides and headed towards the rails at a slant, a bullet was put into his head by an aerial sniper. From reports, the bus hit the ground and exploded into a fiery blaze. There were no survivors, and many bodies were never discovered or declared missing., One report from a bystander (26 year-old woman driving in the next lane over who was suspended upside down by her seat belt and sustained a blow to her head from the crash) is of particular interest. She states that she saw a second identical bus rise out of the smoke and pull aside the wreck. It opened its door with a large mechanical sound and waited there for a few seconds, until out of the flames came a single burning silhouette shaped like a human corpse. This corpse was said to have entered the bus and sat down, which then pulled away, smoothly navigating the pileup before disappearing., We tried the same parameters (real vehicle, real passenger, real driver who knows what's going on and is in contact) three more times, but with trains this time. We also had agents stationed at the train each time. However, the same mix-up happened over and over again: the prisoners inexplicably went on the wrong (unsafe) train, even if it was clear which one to enter. Somehow they got disoriented in the mob and entered the incorrect train, one with no personnel, safeties, or special equipment on it. From my assistant, Dr. Haber's log (following his recovery from his prior accident):, Addendum 342 G: Cessation of Experimentation Order: Somehow in the course of the most recent events, Dr. Haber got his neck stuck in the door when trying to help one of the subjects exit the train. As the train pulled away from the station, he was decapitated when it went past a jutting stone ledge. Because of this and the other unmitigatable casualties that happen after every normal experiment (one test subject per experiment), we have decided to end our research. O5-08, upon our urging, has invoked Statute 62, meaning that no other teams can perform trials on the object without our permission or the overruling of all twelve Overseers. We have decided to grant permission if they come to us with a novel test idea, one that has not been done before, as the usual experiments only waste lives and grant us no additional information., On a related note, several civilians have been buzzing on the topic of a haunting: specifically, some kind of specter on the train systems that carries a mysterious bundle in its lap while riding the trains, roughly the size of a human head. We have taken in several witness, but under no amount of hypnosis and drugging could they give a description of the apparition's face, saying it was obscured by darkness, or tell us what was beyond the shoulders at all., Addendum 342\u00a0H: Excerpt from Dr. Gunsther's Personal Log: Doctor Joahnes Getrim has disappeared from his house today. You can't escape, in the end., A year ago, we tried an experiment where the ticket would be torn but the rider would not get on. Doctor Getrim decided to be the one to redeem the ticket, and immediately afterwards, hand it to an agent and walk away to a special on-site protection zone, keeping a journal of his experiences. The journal (attached to the file) speaks of severe anxiety, neurosis, fear, and paranoia. He had unrelenting fear of roads, and often spent the night on-site so he would not have to leave., After several weeks of not leaving work, and suffering the mental and physical results of that, he was sent to a psychologist for review. He brought up his research, and asked to be quarantined, for his own safety and others, but the way he went about his plea prejudiced many against him, and sent a ripple of disgust over his pathetic antics through the office. His tactics backfired and instead he was merely shunted off to some small project not even directly involving SCPs., The entire group was becoming more and more fed up with him, arriving late, sweating profusely, and looking disheveled because he had walked the whole way, refusing to accompany any field work that involved getting there by transportation, and especially at his habit of always requesting rides home, both for personal reasons and because his car (a brand new Mercedes) kept breaking down on the way home. After attacking a tow truck driver with his own wrench for telling him he should take a bus home, he was dismissed for an undecided amount of time and confined to house arrest., This morning, thick tire tracks were found on the suburban street where he lives. He was reported missing by his wife, who remembers hearing him say, \"Well, I guess it's time to go.\" Neighbors report being woken up by the loud sound of a door opening and the sound of a large vehicle driving away. A suitcase, filled with his clothing, was found by the side of the road. Had he accepted his fate in the end enough to pack? Either way, he apparently didn't need it where he was going., "

[     ]-A is burnt orange in color while [     ]-B is mustard yellow. At the base of each creature is a wheel-like protrusion which allows for locomotion, suggesting that the creatures may be biomechanical in origin. The subjects can move surprisingly fast, covering over 60\u00a0m (200 ft) in a matter of seconds. The subjects, however, lack a braking system, which has led to some rather spectacular, if not overly amusing, mishaps involving the creatures. The subjects have also shown the ability to climb sheer surfaces, and have gotten lost in the air vents on more than one occasion., The subjects seem to have the intelligence of common house cats and are insatiably curious. Most of the time they simply roll around the facility, observing personnel at work and catching peeks at other Safe class SCPs. The subjects seem to be able to communicate with each other via an untranslatable high-pitched babbling. The subjects have never been observed to blink, even in laboratories when the subjects have been videotaped for over 18 consecutive hours., The subjects seem to respond well to any affection given to them and will quickly bond to the giver of said affection, much in the same way a puppy bonds with a human being. They will follow anyone or anything they've made a bond with anywhere, even into normally restricted areas. Although curious, the subjects can sense danger in their general vicinity, and if the object of their bond begins to approach something they register as dangerous (e.g., Euclid or Keter class objects) they will swarm around their bonded companion's feet (or appropriate extremities) while babbling in a panicked tone, as if to warn them. Because of the daily dangers faced by Site-19 staff in dealing with Euclid and Keter class objects, it is recommended that staff avoid making attempts to bond with the subjects, as it can pose a distraction during delicate operations and experiments and may pose a danger to the subjects themselves (see Addendum 131-1). If the subjects are ignored by their bonded target long enough, they will eventually lose interest and return to their normal activities., It should be noted that the subjects require no real care or maintenance from the site staff. They do not eat, leave droppings, or even sleep. It would seem that the only sustenance they require is visual stimulation (although this requires further study to verify)., Subjects [     ]-A and [     ]-B were found in a cornfield outside \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in the year 19\u2588\u2588. They were promptly transported to Site-19 via [DATA EXPUNGED] and were then downgraded to Safe class and given free reign across the site once it became clear they were not broadcasting what they saw to any hostile foreign powers., "

This voice will make offers and promises, attempting to tempt the occupant of [     ]-2. Meaning has been extracted from the spoken voice. If, in this time, the entity sitting in [     ]-2 makes a request, then the tempting and offers will cease. There will be a pause and a price will be stated. This can be bargained with; however, the voice will insist on other prices of \u2018equal value.\u2019 Occasionally when a request is made the voice will respond by telling the requester that they \u2018do not want the object enough\u2019 or that they are \u2018obviously requesting the object for someone else to get around paying full price\u2019 in which case the request is not fulfilled. This occurs most frequently for requests that can affect other people, or can transfer possession., Accepting the deal causes the agreed-upon wish or command to be fulfilled to the letter, but not past the letter. Furthermore it will cause the occurrences stated in the price to be paid. The entity has actively stated that the occurrences in the price are intended to cause an amount of emotional and/or physical pain equal to the amount that the requester desires what they request. How parity is calculated is at present unknown. The price has also been stated to be independent of any pain caused by fulfilling the request.

However, all attempts to observe this entity when not seated in [     ]-2 have failed, and further descriptions of the entity are inconsistent between sessions, even with multiple sessions with the same person.

All personnel working at Area 114 must have a high aptitude for parapsychology or a strong resilience to perception shifts., Description: [     ] is a Caucasian male, standing at 1.95 meters tall. The subject\u2019s appearance is unremarkable, aside from a small birthmark on its right shoulder. [     ]\u2019s anomalous traits include its inability to be harmed or killed., All actions carried out by [     ] will be perceived by surrounding individuals as being within expectations for the situation. [     ] has been known to attack personnel who will then believe circumstance or their own doing has hurt them. The subject is able to affect electronic and automatic systems., [     ] was brought to the attention of the Foundation because of its inability to be harmed and was classified as an Anomalous Object after initial testing. The subject was held at Site \u2588\u2588\u2588 in the Anomalous Object wing of the facility. On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a site-wide security failure and subsequent containment breach resulted in the on-site nuclear warhead being detonated., [     ] was declared missing after a search of the site did not reveal a confirmed death. A low priority search was issued, but was soon raised to high priority after the above document was found. MTF-Eta-6 (aka. Awareness Filters) was formed to find [     ]., Addendum-1504-1: After being further analyzed and sent through multiple filters, it was discovered that [     ]\u2019s responses were different from what was previously recorded.

When the tub is not full (i.e. when it is partially or almost-fully emptied) the Lego will slowly duplicate themselves, stopping when the container is full., The interesting property of [     ] is that, when constructed by a human hand (see Addendum 387-d) the constructions will animate themselves, performing activities based on their surroundings. For example, if a Legoman \u2013 which is a \u201cman\u201d constructed using the provided humanoid parts - is placed within a car, it will begin to drive it. Further experimentation has revealed that the car (and indeed, any complex machine) needs no internal engine or power source. The legopeople have some form of sentience, as they interact with each other quite readily., If left over time, the constructed people and buildings will evolve.

It twists and tapers somewhat as it rises from the ground. The top third of the tower is empty. An inner wall in the lower area renders it opaque to imaging. [     ] can open an aperture anywhere on its surface., [     ] produces and controls an estimated 13,500 \"servitors\", collectively designated [     ]-1. Specimens of [     ]-1 are cybernetically augmented animals. These augmentations usually force the animals into a bipedal gait, and are often accompanied by crude cosmetic alterations such as the removal of a snout, with the apparent goal of making the servitors appear more human-like. The nervous system of members of [     ]-1 is slaved to implanted electrodes, which allow them to be controlled by a central source, assumed to be the tower itself., These servitors fulfill a number of roles. Many of them mine for ore in an extensive system of tunnels excavated below the valley, which is then refined by the tower. Others repair damage to the structure or other servitors. A small number construct roads, apparently to facilitate movement of [     ]-1. The remaining servitors hunt down and destroy all non-human life in the valley.

The progress of the infection is very slow, with some subjects going several years before manifesting any symptoms., [     ] alters the biochemistry of organic tissue, causing organic matter to re-arrange into a form of \u201corganic metal\u201d. The processes involved with this change are not yet fully understood, but the advanced stages are well documented. A subject will begin to turn into a complex arrangement of gears and clockwork, these taking over for the former biological functions. Advanced-stage infection is reported to be very painful, but earlier stages are oftentimes unnoticed, with only vague feelings of confusion, insomnia, and joint stiffness. Hearts are replaced by gears and small tubes, joints by gear networks, eyes by structures not unlike primitive \u201chand-crank\u201d film cameras, etc., [     ] shows first on the outside of the body in all creatures except mammals.

The new clockwork organs appear to tear and rip at tissue for a short time, before becoming fully integrated and settling into the surrounding tissue, and this is believed to account for the pain., Areas infected appear to be metal, mainly brass, steel, and iron. Other substances have been reported, appearing to be leather, rubber, glass, wood, and other basic materials.

Each of their four limbs end in three-fingered claws with a fourth, opposable digit, and are covered in setae which considerably augment climbing ability. Their heads are elongated, devoid of even vestigial eyes or eye sockets, and contain no brain casing. The jaws of [     ] are lined with red, faintly luminescent fang-like teeth, similar to those belonging to specimens of the genus Chauliodus, up to 6\u00a0cm in length, and encircled by heat-sensitive pit organs.

[     ] have no apparent physiological need to feed, nor any way to digest consumed tissue. Ingested material typically accumulates in the respiratory system of [     ] and is regurgitated once the amount is sufficient to markedly inhibit its function. Despite the absence of many vital organ systems, [     ] are capable of bearing live young. See Addendum 10-16-1991., [     ]'s primary method of luring prey is the imitation of human speech in the voices of prior victims, though imitation of other species and active nocturnal hunts have been documented. [     ] vocalizations often imply significant distress; whether [     ] understand their vocalizations or are repeating previously heard phrases is the subject of ongoing study. How [     ] acquire voices is not currently understood; specimens have been documented imitating victims despite never hearing the victim speak. Analysis of [     ] vocalizations cannot distinguish between [     ] and samples of known victims' voices. The use of biometric voice-recognition security or identification systems at any installation housing [     ] is strongly discouraged for this reason.

It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless with an estimated ECt50 for inhalation of 0.0015mg\u2022min/m3. In well-ventilated or open air environments, risk of exposure to ECt50 is greatly reduced but not negligible. AMN-C227 is typically undetectable in the bloodstream sixty (60) minutes following cessation of exposure. Reported sensations of disorientation and mild hallucinations immediately following removal from environments saturated with the agent are similar to recreational use of numerous psychoactive substances and easily mistaken as such., Note 03-23-2005: This report pertains to morphology alpha.

The building consists of a factory floor and an observation room on the second floor, separated from the main room by one-way mirrors. There are three entrances to the building:, When the main building is entered via the loading dock or employee entrance, no anomalies are observed, merely an empty room in severe disuse and disrepair with a small amount of metallic debris consistent with a stripped down, abandoned factory. The inside staircase leading up to the observation room is missing and inaccessible, and so far every attempt to enter the observation room via the inside of the factory through the access door or windows has failed., When the observation room is entered via the second-floor outside door, a factory observation room consistent in disuse and disrepair to the rest of the building is found. However, when the factory floor is viewed through the observation room windows, the anomalous property of [     ] is visible., The view from the observation room window shows a static, repeating scene that lasts approximately 11.3 seconds before repeating. Visible through the window is a room of the same dimensions and layout as the factory floor, but painted white and sterilized. Set up in the middle of the room is a huge electronic device of indeterminate function covering at least 50 square meters and extending approximately 2 meters in height at its highest point. Five individuals in white clean suits appear to be working on the device., Approximately 5.9 seconds into the scene, the employee entrance door bursts open and four individuals wearing black tactical armor with no identifying marks or emblems enter the room and open fire on the research personnel. At 11.3 seconds, the device in the center of the room emits an intense flash of light and radiation, and the scene resets. Analysis of thousands of instances of the scene has shown no variation in the sequence., So far, all attempts at interacting with the scene have failed; any attempts to breach the window or door from within the observation room are met with resistance inconsistent with the suggested strength of the materials comprising their frames. To date, all attempts that have resulted in successful penetration of the door or window have resulted in the damage being instantly reverted along with the sequence during the burst of light. Any tools or limbs extended outside of the observation room are cleanly severed, and have never been found., Research is ongoing into the nature of the device at the center of [     ], as well as the identities of the individuals involved., "

        "text": " [     ] is the remains of an art installation titled \"World Without Man,\" revealed on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, by the defunct artists' group Unelmat Paremmasta Maailmasta. According to documentation retrieved and deleted from the artists' website during clean-up procedure, [     ] was originally a large, clear globe of the Earth, with several smaller globes and video equipment within. Promotional material on the website implied that the globe was to display images of pastoral wilderness untouched by mankind contrasted with visuals of abandoned human industry and decaying landmarks., Upon activation before a small audience of prominent environmental activists and artists from the nearby community of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, [     ] began to display its destructive properties. We can only speculate if the device's output was intentional or not, as those involved in its construction perished during the incident or have gone into hiding., While the globes within [     ] rotate, all man-made artifacts within approximately 100 meters begin to rapidly deteriorate until completely disintegrated. The effect applies to anything ranging from machinery to buildings, clothing, plastics, synthetic chemical compounds and any tool more complex than a sharpened stick of wood. The area of effect grows the longer the device is active, with the effect growing ever stronger at its source. Human tissue is also affected at a slower rate of decay, causing victims to become emaciated as they lose body mass\u2014leading up to collapse of the skeleton and death, with the body swiftly breaking down into component matter shortly thereafter. Non-human life is completely unaffected. Persons who escape the area of effect experience symptoms similar to prolonged starvation but can return to full health with proper care., If not for the fact that it is not entirely immune to its own effect, [     ] would have had the potential to remove all trace of humanity from the globe in a matter of weeks. Judging from the observed rate of destruction upon original activation versus its current capabilities under testing, [     ]'s capabilities have been impaired by the damage it caused to itself. However, sustained use still presents an extreme threat especially if the device is somehow refined or repaired., Due to the circumstances in which [     ] was secured it is strongly believed that the device also possesses some form of mental compulsion on those who view it, but testing is still on-going to determine if that property has also been compromised by the decay of [     ] and how it might be contained. See Recovery Log for further information., Recovery Log [     ]: Approximately 5 minutes after activation, the effect of [     ] reached the nearby community of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Citizens who were not at the art show initially responded with panic and made several emergency calls. Due to the extreme remote location of the town, the first response was made by a small single-prop aircraft which arrived about thirty minutes later. Although the plane entered the area of effect and was quickly lost, the pilot did relay a radio message describing the swift and complete destruction of the town's buildings. At this point, the Foundation became aware of the situation and teams of agents were sent to investigate., By the time agents were able to arrive on scene, [     ] had been intermittently active for nearly eight hours and as a result the town and everything in a radius of [DATA EXPUNGED] was wiped clean of any trace of human civilization. Upon arrival, one plane was immediately affected; fortunately, the crew was able to make an emergency landing before the physical structure of the plane collapsed around them. Unfortunately, their equipment and clothing was also quickly disintegrated, exposing them to the extreme cold of northern Alaska. As a result, six agents had to be treated for hypothermia, but all are expected to return to duty with no lasting effects., After recovering the crew of the downed plane, agents set up a perimeter and were able to observe the epicenter of [     ]'s effect. The surviving population of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had crowded around the remains of the device. All subjects observed were severely emaciated and suffering from severe hypothermia. Exposure had only worsened the effect of [     ] and many subjects were observed with missing digits and even limbs. The survivors were approaching the device in teams of two to three to push at the single remaining globe within [     ]'s housing in order to maintain its effect. As each subject eventually succumbed and collapsed, another from the crowd of onlookers would shuffle forward to take their place. Survivors were seen to be cheering and encouraging those who were maintaining the device until their turn to push the frosted globe came up, although such manual operation was not sufficient to maintain even the radius of effect the device had achieved before damaging itself., Agents were authorized by O5-\u2588 to open fire on the crowd. Although bullets experience the same decay as any other artifact, their velocity was enough to strike lethal wounds before decomposition. When the remaining globe of [     ] ceased to spin, the effect ended and agents were able to move in and secure the device. Survivors attempted to resist but lacked the strength to impede Foundation agents and began to act in a disoriented manner once they were removed from [     ]. With no adequate facilities remaining to provide shelter for them all, many survivors chose to simply lie down in the snow and die while others attempted to provoke agents into using lethal force upon them. Those who were taken into custody refused to answer any questions and were able to refuse enough care that they did not recover from their physical decay., As exposure to the extreme elements of northern Alaska appears to adequately contain [     ] by freezing its remaining machinery in place, it was decided to leave the device on site and under guard along with a [DATA EXPUNGED] in the unlikely event that a hostile faction attempts to secure the device., Addendum [     ] is not to be contained within any Foundation facility until it is certain that we will be able to prevent anyone from being compelled to activate or maintain the rotation of the globe. Even a few minutes of [     ]'s effect could destroy its own containment and seriously compromise any other containment nearby., Contingency 804-X [DATA EXPUNGED], "

In contrast to mundane water, [     ] assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C, and a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100\u00b0C, [     ] vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam., Examinations of the atomic structure of [     ] have proved inconclusive. The substance appears to be identical to normal water molecules, with the exception of [REDACTED] in contrast to standard laws of enthalpy. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Site \u2588\u2588's resident expert on Xenospatial Physics suggests that [     ] may originate in a universe with alternate physical laws., The most hazardous property of [     ], however, is its ability to contaminate normal H2O.

The time it takes for this process to occur varies depending on temperature and the exact chemical composition of affected matter, and had been observed as taking between 3 minutes and \u2588\u2588 hours., Experiments on D-Class personnel have illustrated the process of conversion by the substance, which has been found to follow a consistent pattern:, 1. Initial Exposure: Subject is exposed to [     ], and it begins assimilating any moisture present on the exposed surface. Creatures in this stage do not commonly notice any unusual symptoms except for a slight warming sensation., 2. Surface Conversion: Frost begins to form on the exposed area as the heat produced by the subject and [     ] itself raises its temperature above 0\u00b0C. This stage can take anywhere from one (1) minute to \u2588 hours, during which time subjects begin to feel [REDACTED] crystals from the epidermis., 3. Deep Tissue Conversion: Exponential increase in temperature of [     ] causes runaway reaction throughout subject's body, resulting in [REDACTED].

However, [     ] itself had been abandoned since 19\u2588\u2588, and it is unknown whether its special properties manifested before or after its abandonment.

The testimony of the lone \"winner\" when she turned herself in to the police was enough to have Foundation assets mobilize to contain [     ]., Upon entering [     ], visitors are immediately greeted by an anonymous announcer, who communicates via intercom and is able to hear and comprehend the voices of people within [     ]. The announcer will inform the \"contestants\" that they are about to take part in a game show in which the winners will win fabulous prizes, but will also warn that the game will be extremely hazardous, and that the losers will never leave [     ]. It is at this point the announcer presents the choice of whether to stay or leave [     ]. Contestants who accept will continue to participate in the game while those who decline are immediately expelled from [     ]. Contestants that win the game or decline to participate may never enter [     ] again, as entry is denied by an impenetrable, invisible barrier., It is then that the contestants are led to the actual game. The style, composition, and appearance of the game always changes in every individual play-through, but the game is always centered around a long, elaborate obstacle course that the contestants must navigate through. The rules also vary. Some play-throughs may only allow a single winner, while others encourage the creation of teams to win the game. More often than not, the obstacles seen in these games range from incredibly benign to extremely hazardous and life-threatening. As the contestants attempt to negotiate the course, the announcer will continuously update their status and actively participate in the game, often giving advice, conversing with contestants, and adding new rules. As the game progresses, the obstacles become significantly more dangerous and difficult to overcome, and it is not surprising to have the entire pool of contestants succumb to the rigors of the obstacle course. If such an event happens, the announcer will express sadness at the lack of a winner and [     ] will shut down, resetting only when a new batch of contestants enter., Any attempts to \"break the rules\", such as assaulting other contestants and deliberately bypassing obstacles, are met by extreme violence. The announcer will call out the offending contestant, who will be quickly and forcefully ejected from the course by \"studio guardians\". These studio guardians will immediately materialize within [     ] when called upon by the announcer and disappear when not needed. The contestant will never be seen again., When a winner is declared, he/she will receive a random grand prize. Any contestants that have survived the course but failed to win are immediately declared losers by the announcer. The lights will switch off, and the winner will immediately appear outside of [     ] with his/her prize while the losers completely disappear., However, the most mysterious aspect of [     ] is that after every game, a VHS tape or DVD will appear in the mailbox outside of [     ]'s main entrance. This recording is a complete record of the entire game that was previously played, even though winners have claimed that they had never seen any cameras or recording devices inside [     ]. Also, more strangely, a live studio audience can be seen in the background cheering on the contestants. Again, winners have claimed not to have seen a live studio audience while inside [     ]., Addendum 1: So far, the list of prizes awarded to winners has included, but is not limited to: cash prizes, electronics, various consumer goods, cars, collectibles, full-paid vacations to various countries, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Close examination of these prizes have confirmed that they are completely genuine, and possess no unusual abilities or characteristics whatsoever. There appears to be no consistent pattern for what the prizes will be., Addendum 2: In an attempt to track where the \"losers\" are taken, GPS locator beacons were planted on subjects D-124 through D-135 when Group D245 was sent into [     ]. When the losers were taken away, all signals from the beacons were lost. Whether this is because the beacons were destroyed, or because the losers were taken to an area that cannot be located via GPS is currently unknown., Addendum 3: The announcer living within [     ] appears to be sentient and aware of events that take place outside of the compound. During the test of Group D523, which consisted only of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the announcer instead engaged in a conversation with Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Analysis of the conversations have shown that the majority of the subjects are centered around pop culture and information distributed through television, implying that [     ] somehow is able to access and interpret television signals. Cutting all power and signal lines, as well as removing any potential wireless receiving equipment on [     ], does not affect [     ] in any way. When it became clear that no other contestants would participate, the announcer kindly asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to leave [     ] and suggested he return with more contestants., "

The amount of time into the future traveled by the subject is related to the amount of energy input into [     ]. An approximate estimate of 3500 kWh in order to send a subject seven months into the future has been documented; however, this relationship becomes unpredictable at higher energy levels., Subjects using [     ] will exist in the time period to which they have traveled for a duration ranging between 15 and 38 weeks before spontaneously returning to the time period of origination at a point coterminous with their present location.

        "text": " [     ] is an insect of unknown origin, somewhat resembling a greyish, semitranslucent Forficula auricularia (common earwig), approximately 2.5\u00a0cm in length. Originally located/obtained in mainland China in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 province. No other specimen has been found, as of yet., [     ] is relatively harmless when encountered on safe terms, aside from the ability to deliver a firm, painful pinch with its abdominal forceps. The true hazard this creature poses lies in its habitat construction and reproduction, which is initiated when the specimen enters the mouth of a sleeping human. This will only occur with humans; other lifeforms have been presented to [     ] and have been uniformly rejected. Upon location of a suitable host, the specimen will hide itself in the immediate vicinity and wait until the victim has fallen asleep. How it is able to determine the state of sleep is unknown, but it has shown to be accurate in [DATA EXPUNGED] times out of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Upon entering the mouth of the new host, [     ] will travel down the trachea and take up residence in one of the victim's lungs., In approximately 4-8 hours, after awakening, the host will complain of chest pains and shortness of breath, followed shortly by abdominal cramping. The tightness in the chest will increase as well as a fever until the host is incapacitated. It is around this time that the onset of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) occurs, a disorder that is normally genetic in nature that promotes growth of bone into muscle tissue. Since the production of new bone growth is so rapid, the procedure is also quite painful for the subject, with new bone spurs occasionally protruding through the flesh. While this is happening, the host will become compelled to seek shelter in a darkened, enclosed space, such as inside household cabinetry, closets, or heating ductwork., Within the first three days without treatment, the host will become completely withdrawn and immobile due to the extreme pain of new bone growth coupled with difficulty breathing. At this point, the subject's body will begin the final stage of transformation into a \"bone hive\": having concealed itself in its new home, the body of the host will huddle in a foetal position. Entire portions of the skeletal structure will shift along [DATA EXPUNGED] until the host body is roughly spherical in nature and reduced to 3/4 its original size. New bone protrusions will continue to grow and, if possible, anchor the body permanently to its new location. The skeletal structure is almost completely unrecognizable, having been converted to a round \"cage\" to protect the internal organs and colony., At this point, transformation is complete. The original Queen that entered the host will have produced 20-30,000 offspring that function as workers, drones and warriors in a typical insect hive hierarchy. Since only the Queen is capable of reproduction, the rest of the hive's inhabitants are, fortunately, harmless save for large, strong abdominal forceps of the warriors. The interior of the original host is nearly unrecognizable as a human body: certain organs are removed and used as food, while others are modified by the worker insects to serve as egg incubation chambers. An ingenious method exists of using the host\u2019s own digestive system to process pieces of organic materials collected by the warriors into a nutritive slurry that feeds both the colony and sustains the host hive structure., After 4-6 months, a new Queen will emerge from within the ranks and choose a drone to mate with.

Patient Zero was brought into captivity, and the mine shaft was collapsed by explosive device., [     ] has an incubation period ranging from 24 hours to two (2) years, depending on the presence and number of other human hosts in the area. First symptoms resemble the common cold, and include itchy eyes, runny nose, coughing, and bodily aches. Phase two begins in 48 hours, and consists of a controlled form of hemorrhagic fever, as the organism causes a small amount of blood to become aspirated in the lungs, creating an aerosol effect. During phase three, the host \"crashes and bleeds out,\" bleeding profusely from every bodily orifice, including the nose, tear ducts, anus, skin pores, mouth, urethra, and (in case of females) vagina. Blood pressure skyrockets during the final stage: hosts have been observed projectile vomiting blood to distances of over five (5) meters. Should the host survive this near-total exsanguination, the pathogen will become dormant once more, returning to incubation phase., What distinguishes [     ] from other strains of hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola and Marburg is its unusual response to high stress. Should the subject undergo a high-stress situation (such as a life-threatening crisis), the organism will change its survival tactic from rapid reproduction to the rewriting of the host's DNA and stimulation of rapid cell division. Major physiological changes occur within the first 24 hours, with complete bodily reconstruction occurring within two (2) weeks time. Most hosts do not survive the process due to the heavy demands made on the body.1, An interesting side effect of the transformation is an increased aggressive urge. It is believed that this may be an attempt to maximize the spread of the virus in a manner similar to rabies. On another note, subjects who undergo bodily transformation no longer appear to exhibit [     ]'s hemorrhagic properties: however, subjects infected by transformed hosts will still undergo the normal [     ] infection process., "

Testing reveals [     ]-1 to predate earliest known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years. [     ]-1 is considered sentient but not actively dangerous except under certain conditions., [     ]-1 was found on a stone tablet, [     ]-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on [     ]-2 are not part of any known language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns., [     ]-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the contents of which are mostly inaccessible without risk of damaging [     ]-2. [     ]-2 is capable of controlled emissions of radiation, including heat, light, and anomalous radiation types. [     ]-2 contains an internal power source of an anomalous nature, which appears to have been losing power since several centuries before discovery., It is considered probable that [     ]-2 was created for the purpose of containing [     ]-1. Partially interpreted data recovered from [     ]-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future LK-class restructuring event caused by [     ]-1., [     ] was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears possible that SRV-04 Beta was deliberately contacted by [     ]-2. Other organizations have also been alerted to [     ]'s existence, possibly by similar means. Despite this activity, [     ]-2 does not appear to be sentient, based on its lack of reaction to M03-Gloria analysis and procedures., When [     ] drops below the temperature of 35\u00b0C, both components react., First, [     ]-1 enters a growth state characterized by an exponential increase in mass. This growth state consists of two stages. In both stages, [     ]-1 partially fuels its growth by converting matter around it, starting with any surrounding inorganic material, including atmospheric elements, then nonliving organic material, including cells of dead skin, hair, chitin, enamel, keratin, and other biological materials., The first stage is always the same. [     ]-1 will first increase its mass, then take a form similar in shape to an ophiuroid (brittle star) of fifteen meters in diameter (including what appears to be a central processor of three meters in diameter). It will form sensory organs that appear to scan its surrounding environment, and will partially convert the area around it to an unidentified anomalous substance ([     ]-2 seems immune from conversion)., The second stage describes a growth alteration which occurs when [     ] comes into contact with living organic material; [     ] appears to \"template\" itself off of the organic material, and will attempt communication with organisms that match its initial \"template\" or \"templates\"., In its second stage, [     ]-1 may pause, slow or change its growth, and will also convert inorganic and nonliving organic elements into functionally similar structures while anomalously altering their physical makeup., While growth is consistent in the first stage, in the second stage [     ]-1's growth rate is diminished by 20-90% so long as [     ]-1 remains in contact with living organic material. The percentage is determined by the complexity of the organism(s) in contact with [     ]-1; [     ]-1 appears to devote a large amount of processing power to analysis of living organic material., During each of [     ]-1's growth stages, [     ]-2 releases bursts of radiation that temporarily inhibit [     ]-1's growth, or reverse this growth when the temperature of [     ]-1 rises above 100\u00b0C. Similar radiation emissions have been replicated or recorded via other anomalous means., [     ]-1's biology has been the subject of extensive study. Significant elements have been identified similar to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, [     ], and [     ], the latter two of which have no further confirmed connection with [     ]-1 and no known connection with each other, and none of which are fully understood (technically, even less understood than [     ], thanks to the extensive cross-disciplinary research on the [     ] objects). To date, no convincing analysis has been put forward which satisfactorily explains [     ]-1's connection to these SCP objects or others, nor its connection to modern technology beyond appearance (and potential mimicry via unknown mechanism)., Addendum 003-01: Acting on information gathered from linguistic analysis of [     ]-2's runes and comparative data analysis, Research Team M03-Gloria has managed to establish a link between [     ] and [DATA EXPUNGED] for analysis of functions. [     ]-1 must now be considered sentient, and is to be kept a minimum of 1\u00a0km from [DATA EXPUNGED] and the resulting \"by-product\" at all times., Addendum 003-02: [     ]-2's power loss has been exacerbated by the procedures performed by M03-Gloria. On orders of O5-10, M03-Gloria will continue procedures., Addendum 003-03: During M03-Gloria procedures, [     ]-1 doubled its mass and began rapid structural growth. Temperature was immediately returned to 100\u00b0C. Growth and mass increase of [     ]-1 continued for 9 minutes and 6 seconds, at which time a sustained radiation spike was produced by [     ]-2. In response, [     ]-1 returned to its normal state in 3 minutes and 39 seconds. New growth dissolved into a dusty residue which was collected for analysis. Both [     ]-1 and [     ]-2 ceased all detectable activity. [     ]-2 did not resume activity until connected to external power source. [     ]-2's runes glowed uniformly gray and did not resume normal activity for three (3) hours. [     ]-2 no longer appears to be able to maintain containment area at a temperature above 35\u00b0C without external power supplied by Generators 003-III through IX., Addendum 003-04: The procedure detailed in Addendum 003-03 was repeated, and [     ]-1 again entered a growth state. After 10 minutes and 13 seconds, [     ]-2 once again produced a sustained radiation spike. [     ]-1's growth stopped for 36 seconds, then resumed at its previous pace., On quadrupling its mass, [     ]-1 formed a coherent outer shell and body. After appearing to scan its environment and partially converting its environment, [     ]-1 then breached containment, entering the observation gallery where nine members of M03-Gloria were present. On physical contact with team members, [     ]-1 encompassed them in rapidly-grown appendages and stopped growth for 15 minutes. [     ]-1 then resumed growth, and rearranged the component parts of the center of its form to the shape of a three-meter-tall female humanoid, with peripheral \"tentacles\" shifting to extrude primarily from [     ]-1's newly formed \"hair\" and spine. [     ]-1 then produced rudimentary vocalizations in an apparent initial attempt to communicate with researchers. [DATA EXPUNGED], An unknown individual approached the compromised containment area in company of a full squad of agents. The individual claimed to be acting on orders of O5-10 and attempted communication with [     ]-1. [DATA EXPUNGED], Following this incident, Agent Jackson of M03-Gloria successfully restored power to [     ]-2 and activated backup generators to return the temperature to 100\u00b0C. [     ]-1 returned to its normal state in 21 minutes and 7 seconds, and was successfully re-contained without incident., All nine members of M03-Gloria affected by [     ]-1 were afterwards found to be physically unharmed, with no residual effects besides psychological trauma. The converted materials of [     ]'s former containment area did not dissolve and are now under analysis., "

Mild, fluctuating gravitational effects have also been observed., It has proven impossible to take a sample of the artifact. Spectrographic attempts have proven inconclusive. Although not particularly heavy (weighing ~14Kg), inertial and angular momentum studies suggest that neutronium1 (in vanishingly small quantities) may be present in the body of the mechanism., [     ] demonstrates its anomalous properties when it is handled by a human being. When moderate force is applied to it, it will begin to deform in unpredictable ways, its material composition will appear to change, and it will become animated, surrounding the subject in convolutions and undulating increasingly faster. Its primary effect will manifest itself when an unpredictable threshold is met, after which the artifact will return to its original state., At this point, the subject will have had their memories altered. They will no longer agree with the historical record, often profoundly. Their self-reported personal history will be at odds with Foundation personnel records. As a consequence, they will often assume a posture of agitation and paranoia. The more pronounced the deformation of the artifact, the more divergent their memories will be. It is theorized that the glyphs, via means as of yet unknown, control the degree of deformation and its resultant effects., Recovery Log: [     ] was recovered in late 2001 from a core-sample extracted \u2588\u2588 Km deep during a petrochemical survey near Zackenberg, Greenland. Based on the depth from which it was recovered \u2014 along with corroborating paleoatmospheric readings \u2014 the artifact is estimated to be 31\u00b1 2.3 million years old., Foundation personnel intercepted the radio transmission of its discovery and, owing to its unusual nature and age, moved to secure the artifact. Class B amnestics were administered to the personnel in Greenland, along with those individuals at the governing authority in Denmark who had been made aware of its discovery. Once on site, it was discovered that one of the geological engineers had been placed under a 72 hour psychiatric hold after violently assaulting a colleague and behaving in a manner consistent with the Foundation test subject (see below). It is presumed that they had handled the artifact., "

        "text": " [     ] is a morgue in the basement of [REDACTED] Hospital in Great Britain. Until 198\u2588, there were no reported anomalous occurrences within the morgue. Reports of strange activity were first received in November of 198\u2588. The area was soon quarantined by the Foundation, with an official story being released that the entire building had been condemned. The reason for the sudden manifestation of its strange properties remains under investigation., Periodically, a random drawer within the morgue will open to reveal a cadaver under a covered sheet. After approximately six minutes open, the cadaver will animate and attempt to leave the morgue. At this point, the cadaver is given the designation [     ]-1. In some cases the cadaver will be too damaged or decomposed to successfully exit [     ] or even rise from the table it lies on. In this case, [     ]-1 will typically struggle and twitch on the table until expiration occurs. Should an instance of [     ]-1 expire while remaining on the table, the table slides back into the drawer, which then shuts. Reports indicate that the scent of burnt tissue is evident immediately following such an event., The energy source that sustains instances of [     ]-1 is currently unknown. Instances do not breathe, eat, or sleep, and their bodies produce no heat. Analysis of [     ]-1 following expiration has discovered no abnormal organs or chemicals present; they appear to be fully human cadavers., Instances also possess physical strength that exceeds that of normal humans. Though direct testing has proven problematic, researchers estimate the strength increase to be approximately 500\u00a0N (112\u00a0lb) of lifting force greater than what one would expect of a human body sharing a similar condition. Analysis is underway to determine if this effect is connected to the unknown power source or if it is an entirely separate phenomenon., When body parts are severed from [     ]-1, the portion with the greatest mass retains its effects; all other pieces become inert. Destruction of the head or brain does not neutralize [     ]-1; instead, the lower torso and limbs remain animate. Complete tissue destruction appears to be the only method of successfully terminating instances of [     ]-1. Left alone, instances of [     ]-1 will simply expire; all motion ceases and they appear to become normal cadavers again. The amount of time this takes depends on how damaged the body is and the rate of decomposition, and can take anywhere between two days and three weeks., Investigation has revealed that the bodies acting as [     ]-1 match the description of cadavers reported to have been stolen from morgues across the country. The mechanism for this transfer is currently being researched., Adding any new matter to [     ] has thus far proved impossible. Any object that enters [     ] disappears shortly after passing through the door, leaving no trace. This includes inanimate objects and biological specimens. See Addendum 022-001 and 022-002., So long as an instance of [     ]-1 possesses a functioning mouth, tongue, and trachea, it is able to communicate fully with researchers.

The lower jaw, teeth, and larynx have been removed and replaced with [DATA EXPUNGED]. The esophagus has been rerouted to an artificial orifice at the back of the neck (feeding tube), and the trachea rerouted directly to an air filtration device. Due to these alterations, [     ] is incapable of speech, although it has been reported occasionally vocalizing distress through rapid respiration., 2. An input-output device has been placed into the right forearm, replacing the radius and ulna bones. The device contains interfaces for a variety of modern and obsolete formats, including USB, Ethernet, Firewire, and DIN-8 pin, as well as seven (7) other interfaces corresponding to no known formats. The device can be accessed by pulling back the skin over the right arm like a shirt sleeve., 3. A 24-core processor array has been implanted in the brain, which \"translates\" input from all artificial components, essentially allowing [     ] to read and write computer data without the use of an external interface. Internal communication is carried out through fiber optic cables implanted through the glial cells and the entire nervous system. Damage to the brain stem and cerebellum due to the implantation procedure has severely damaged [     ]'s motor skills., 4. The right hand and right foreleg have been replaced with artificial components, consisting primarily of steel, carbon-fiber, and an unknown polymer-like substance. The exposed areas of tissue are susceptible to injury and infection: due to damage to the spinothalamic tract, [     ] has reduced pain and temperature sensitivity in its limbs.

There is a blind spot at the back of the head to make way for an organ used for elimination of bodily waste. The compound eye is separated into 88 units. The most likely hypothesis is that each unit receives only vertical information while the brain intuits horizontal information by comparing input from the different units. The eye is sensitive to light wavelengths between 150 nm and 300 nm, equivalent to UVC which is harmful to most terrestrial life., [     ] contains an endoskeleton which consists of tissue similar in chemical composition and structure to cellulose. The skeletal structure protrudes from the uppermost joint of each leg and appears to have been blunted by mechanical means. No pain response is exhibited when samples are taken from these protrusions. The skin is transparent to visible wavelengths of light, but opaque to ultraviolet. Blood samples taken have an oxygen and carbon dioxide transport system based on nickel, rather than the iron or copper used by terrestrial organisms, and is green in colour. Analysis of blood and tissue shows that [     ]'s cells use DNA for instruction, with the standard GCAT bases; however, a different method is used to interpret said instructions. Sets of three bases still code for amino acids, but they are not the same ones that are coded for in terrestrial cells. In addition, some terrestrial amino acids are not present in its biology while others that it uses are not present in Earth's biosphere, allowing for dramatically different protein arrangements., [     ]'s home environment would have contained different proportions of elements, compared to that of Earth. This is evidenced by its sensitivity to certain common elements and its resistance to other less common ones. [REDACTED], a heavy metal poisonous to terrestrial life, is used in [     ]'s metabolism. Iron and calcium, though not used by [     ], causes no harmful effects to it. Exposure to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in any chemical form causes damage to tissue. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are as harmful to [     ] as they are to us. A full table of safe and unsafe chemicals, along with dietary requirements, is contained in Manual M-163-1. Furthermore, the atmosphere would have had different proportions of gasses. [     ] is able to survive in our atmosphere for some time without mechanical aid, but will begin to show signs of illness after one hour. Air that is filtered to remove certain common terrestrial elements will prevent such an event. Analysis of [     ]'s technology includes searches for hermetically sealed chambers which may contain evidence of its home atmosphere., It is unknown how [     ] communicates complex ideas. The only vocalization produced by it is a steady sinusoidal wave of approximately 15\u00a0Hz when in certain emotional states. There is no variation to this vocalization, which can last from 15 seconds to 10 minutes. It is recommended that personnel exposed to this sound remain in well-lit conditions to prevent feelings of paranoia. Emotions are primarily displayed by the dome of tissue above the compound eye. Different states correspond to distortion of furrows in the skin by subdermal muscles. In addition, a negative and affirmative gesture have been noted. An affirmative consists of the rapid beating together of [     ]'s delicate manipulators while a negative is the same gesture performed by heavy manipulators. Specific information on gestures and emotional states is contained in Manual M-163-2., [     ]-1 appears to be a universal life support device. It is able to convert basic chemical elements into sustenance for [     ], in addition to originally projecting the phenomenon in which [     ] was found. To ensure the continued health of [     ], study of [     ]-1 is forbidden until after the death of [     ]. The function of other equipment is still not fully understood. The technology is limited to crude transistors assembled into various specialized analog computers. Many physical processes that these computers model do not correspond to anything known to modern science. It is theorized that [     ]-1 relies on some of these processes in order to function., [     ] was first discovered by miners in the Andes Mountains on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-20\u2588\u2588. The rock strata in which it was found are approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 years old; shocked minerals in the vicinity indicate that its spacecraft had crash-landed. The miners reported coming across an impenetrable mirrored surface which abruptly disappeared after enough rock was removed from it. The description suggests that this is a larger version of the phenomenon produced by [     ]-1. Despite being encased in stone for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 years, the contents of the chamber showed no sign of age or degradation, believed to be an effect of the phenomenon. Approximately 30% of the equipment had been looted before agents could reach the scene. Though some have since been recovered, there are many items still at large. Agents are continuing to scour the black market for any further clues as to the whereabouts of the missing technology., When agents took control of the scene, [     ] was still encased in the reflective sphere produced by [     ]-1. The relative simplicity of [     ]-1's interface allowed agents to quickly de-activate it. Agents were forced to subdue [     ], which was violent at the time. Aside from this initial confrontation, [     ] has cooperated with the Foundation, to the extent of its ability to understand us., The following are select experiments performed on [     ]. A full list of experiments and results is contained in Manual M-163-2., Experiment Log 163-46: Facial recognition., "

Subject is generally unremarkable, showing typical signs of aging, except for its eyes, which are achromatic, appearing gray. Personnel should avoid mentioning this, as it seems to cause subject some distress. Subject is typically dressed in surgical scrubs, green in color, and is often seen still wearing a surgical cap and mask., When given a set of standard medical tools, [     ] is able to operate on machines as though they were composed of living flesh. Testing confirms that any medical supplies used by [     ] will have this effect. Subject appears to be capable of operating on any machine requiring some kind of energy to operate, whether powered by clockwork, steam, electricity, or [REDACTED]., During an operation, objects appear to be transmuted to living tissue, including skin, bone, musculature, and other organ systems, as well as blood and nervous tissue. Similarly, tissue may be removed and discarded, but will not revert to its original mechanical form. DNA testing on discarded tissue samples reveals [DATA EXPUNGED]. Tissue transmutation appears to be related to position within the object, such as the outermost material becoming like skin, regardless of the type of material. Observation by Foundation medical personnel indicates that the organs present in the object do not correspond to known organs in living animals., The results of [     ]'s surgeries seem to yield fairly mixed results. In approximately 20% of all cases the object may \"die\" on the table, rendering it inoperable. If such an outcome occurs, no amount of repairs, even by technicians specifically trained to maintain and repair the item, will ever return it to working condition; it can, however, be disassembled and used for parts. In some cases, complications may arise from an operation, causing either unexpected or undesirable operation in the object; these can usually be corrected by [     ] with one or more additional procedures., In all cases, objects must heal for a period of time before becoming fully operable again. How long this takes appears to be dependent on how many moving parts a device has, with solid state electronics recovering more quickly than complicated mechanical objects. Recovery time is significantly shorter than expected for similarly complex procedures performed on humans, typically taking only a few hours; however, more complicated devices may require a few days to fully recover., [     ] displays an unusual ability to locate objects which it claims are in need of its services. Before performing surgery, [     ] will interview the object. Video logs show a typical, although one-sided, surgery consult where [     ] asks the object several routine questions about the object's health and the nature of its problems. Afterward, [     ] will give a series of options to the object, make a few notes, and then report back. At no time has an object been recorded or perceived to respond to [     ]'s questioning., Subject displays an apparent apathy toward humans and other living creatures, stating it cannot operate on \"animals\" because it is \"a surgeon, not a [veterinarian]\"., [     ] came to the attention of the Foundation through the use of a routine keyword search before it was scheduled to stand trial in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, for the murder of [REDACTED] on March 1\u2588, 20\u2588\u2588.

Like most machines of this variety, it has a central rectangular space with three clear walls on its front and sides with a black, opaque wall on its back. However, [     ] is unique in that the inner chamber has a solid wood panel floor and no chute where a prize would normally be dispensed., The front panel features two coin slots, a large red button, a microphone, a digital numeric display, a sign that reads \"WIN A COOKIE\", and a thin horizontal slot from which the aforementioned baked goods are dispensed. There is no power cord attached to the back of the machine, nor is one needed, as it is presumably powered via anomalous means. When [     ] is inactive, the central chamber is completely bare. [     ] cannot be forcefully opened or damaged by any known means., When one (1) US quarter-dollar coin is deposited into [     ], a hatch will open in the ceiling of the central chamber and a claw carrying an instance of [     ]-1 will descend from it.

After this message has been played, the button on the front panel will glow and the numeric display will initiate a 15-second countdown.

[     ] typically selects a breed that individual players holds the most affection toward. Aside from the seemingly infinite quantity that [     ] contains, instances of [     ]-1 do not appear to display any innate anomalous properties and generally behave in a manner consistent with animals of their variety; however, [     ]-1 instances may occasionally be subjected to anomalous changes to their physiology or behaviors in order to facilitate the method of destruction dictated by the player., If the player states a method of extermination within the allotted 15 seconds, the hatch in the ceiling of the inner chamber will open and an array of mechanical arms will descend, carrying whatever is necessary to carry out the player's suggestion. Requests for deaths that are not possible within the confines of the chamber will cause [     ] to display additional anomalous properties to carry out its orders (see Experiment Log)., Once the instance of [     ]-1 is deceased, one (1) cookie will be dispensed to the player via the slot in the front of the machine. Cookie flavors dispensed have included chocolate, vanilla, oatmeal, raisin, strawberry, lemon, white chocolate, and peanut butter. The exact variety dispensed to a given player is often the one that the player has the lowest preference for., If the player fails to state a method of extermination or the method proves insufficient, a robotic arm will descend from [     ]'s hatch and bludgeon the [     ]-1 instance until it is deceased. No cookie will be dispensed following this event., [     ] automatically cleans its interior chamber after every game. First, an arm holding a broom descends and sweeps the remains of [     ]-1 into a trapdoor. Next, [     ] wipes down the surfaces of the chamber by deploying arms equipped with flat rubber implements, spray bottles containing a soapy solution, and clean white towels.

Its skin has slight abrasive properties, and is a mottled green color that serves to camouflage it among the reeds in its natural habitat. Its sweat has been observed to act as a mild skin irritant. It has extremely oily black hair that has proven to be resistant to cleaning with conventional shampoos (See Addendum 811-1). It shows partial comprehension of human language, consistent with case studies of \"feral children\" that had been abandoned at a few years old, instead of as infants., The palmoplantar surfaces of [     ]'s skin constantly secrete a clear, green-tinted mucus with minor adhesive properties. This mucus does not appear to have any effect on [     ]'s own tissue, but any other organic matter that it comes into contact with begins to rapidly decompose, through processes not fully understood, reducing the matter into a slightly viscous black liquid.1 [     ] can then absorb said liquid through its skin and directly into its circulatory system. Tests have shown that [     ]'s entire circulatory system is filled with liquefied decaying matter. Biopsies taken from [     ] have shown the presence of anaerobic bacteria in all examined cells, which, due to the apparent lack of anything resembling functional red blood cells in the subject, are currently presumed to be what [     ] uses to metabolise the chemicals in its circulatory system., [     ] does not defecate or otherwise produce feces in the traditional sense, and entirely lacks a small or large intestine. Instead, cellular waste and substances [     ] is unable to metabolise collect in what is, anatomically speaking, its stomach.

It preferentially aims at the face or at any perceived open wounds on its target, then waits for the target to die of either immediate asphyxiation by blockage of the mouth and nose, or in a few days of multi-systemic failure resulting from aggressive bacterial infection. [     ]'s teeth did not seem to have any abnormal resistance to decay resulting from chronic exposure to the compounds and microflora in its waste (See Addendum 811-1)., Prognosis for personnel who have had contact with [     ]'s waste through a mucous membrane or open wound is good if broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is begun in the first three hours, but then rapidly declines.

The staircase emerges from a tower into a large room stacked with bookshelves3. The room does not conform to Euclidian geometry; it is possible to walk in any one direction and eventually return to the point of origin. The room is 312 meters in width, of indeterminate height4, and many hundreds of kilometers in length. Under appropriate lighting conditions or with the use of vision aids, it is possible to see oneself in the distance by looking in the appropriate direction., The room is filled entirely by bookshelves. Each bookshelf is 2.8 meters in height and 100 meters in length, all neatly aligned with 2 meters of walkway space between shelves. An 8 meter wide main walkway originates from the staircase and runs in both directions the full length of [     ], with identical modern-styled couches situated every 20 meters along the main walkway5. Every fifth bookshelf has an electric lamp installed, which are the only light sources within [     ]. As such, most of the space within [     ] is poorly illuminated. No power source has yet been identified for the lights. The floor is covered entirely in a sturdy carpet., Individuals standing within the room will hear steady ruffling noises, and on occasion loud thudding noises. The source of this sound is the origination of bookshelves and new books upon them, which occurs continuously without any obvious source of material6., [     ] represents the complete archive of every human life to date, and is continuously self-updating. Every human being that has ever lived has a single corresponding book within the archive, detailing all important events in their life7. As humans are born, new books corresponding to them are added to the archive. Each book is identical in size and thickness, approximately the size of a standard paperback novel, though the number of pages varies depending upon the individual's lifespan and breadth of accomplishments8. Each book is completely accurate in its contents, and thus [     ] represents an unprecedented intelligence resource. Books are stored in order of individuals' births, and the spine and front cover of each book is inscribed with the name of those it refers to. Each book is written in a language which is unlike any existing language known to the Foundation, while simultaneously being completely comprehensible to any literate individual reading it. The total number of books is estimated at approximately 120 billion9., Books can be taken from the shelves and read freely. Books can be scanned, copied and photographed without consequence. If returned to any of the shelves, the book will vanish and reappear in its original location within the archives. Any attempt to remove a book from the archives results in the book vanishing and returning to its shelf., The contents of the books represent the absolute truth and history of the individuals contained within. Altering the contents of the books has a corresponding retrocausal effect upon reality, with memories, locations, physical structures, physical states, and even complete existences changing accordingly to alterations applied to the books. Writing a decision, meeting, reward, change in personality, change in feeling towards individuals, change in health, method of death, or any other notable achievement or life event into a book will cause that event to transpire for the appropriate individual at the first possible opportunity., Discovery: [     ] was first encountered by Foundation staff in 18\u2588\u2588 after it was uncovered during an archaeological dig under an old part of the city. The Foundation quickly isolated the location and administered amnestics to the archaeologists involved. The Foundation continued to operate the dig site for a few more months, occasionally pretending to find some pottery or bones, in order to avoid drawing suspicion., Initial forays into [     ] were done cautiously, since the extent of the room was not fully understood. Once researchers realised the contents of the archive and the basic nature of the books, advance teams were sent with supplies to place flags at locations of interest, since the bookshelves are not marked nor distinguishable in any way. Seventeen days after beginning their expedition, the first advance team encountered a living individual within [     ], designated [     ]-110, who had survived within [     ] for nearly two millenia (see Addendum 4001-1)., There are currently seven 'camps' within [     ], each with its own generators, water filters, and beacons to aid in locating it, since it can take many days or even weeks to walk between camps11., The oldest of books are estimated to correspond to human births dating back approximately 75,000 years14. Such books, if entitled at all, are entitled with positions within society rather than proper names, such as 'Firebringer', 'Hunter', 'Chief', 'Mother', or 'Friend-Killer'. Regardless of age, all books appear to be in the same condition as the newest of books. Analysis of the earliest of books seems to support the human population bottleneck theory15, with the vast majority of the earliest books representing individuals completely disconnected from those found in other books. As many as half of the books within the archive lack any names or titles, with many more books simply being titled 'The Baby' or 'The Infant', with the book detailing the short life of a baby who died before they could be named., Addendum 4001.1: Interview Log, Addendum 4001.2: Testing Logs, Addendum 4001.3: Cataloging Assistance System, "

Playing the disc results in one of two effects, depending on whether it is a previously watched disc, or an unwatched one., If an unwatched disc is played in a DVD player, the video begins. The scene displayed is a well-furnished living room with a chair in the center. Sitting in the chair is a Caucasian male ([     ]-1), appearing to be around forty years old. [     ]-1 will then demonstrate the ability to react to and converse with anyone watching the video feed. [     ]-1 will respond to any questions put to him, appears to be able to see the environment outside of the video screen, and appears to enjoy discussions and debates with \"viewers\"., If a disc that has already been viewed is viewed again, the disc will simply repeat the footage that was seen the first time. [     ]-1 will not react to viewers' actions, nor deviate at all from the previous viewing. A disc, once played, always contains the same footage, regardless of who is watching it. The only way to communicate with [     ]-1 is to insert a disc that has never been watched. Given that there are 95 discs, each containing three hours of video, it follows that [     ]-1 has an effective lifespan of 285 hours, or 11.8 days, not including footage that has already been watched. It should also be noted that [     ] is not the complete set of discs. Five others are known to exist. It is known that all missing discs have already been fully viewed., [     ]-1 is cognizant of the nature of his own existence. When questioned, he is aware that he is being displayed on a television screen or monitor, and can reliably identify the type, size, and color of the device on which he is shown. When directly asked about his specific nature, however, [     ]-1 will not give a straight answer, preferring to draw the viewer into a discussion or debate. It is not clear whether [     ]-1 is withholding information about his origin, or whether he is uncertain himself. He claims the former, stating that to tell us everything would \"spoil the game\". He neither demonstrates nor admits to any unhappiness with his situation, nor his short lifespan., [     ]-1 retains memory between discs. If one viewer interacts with an unwatched disc, then switches to another disc, [     ]-1 will recognise the viewer and refer to a previous conversation. [     ]-1 has even shown signs of developing a rapport and friendship with those researchers who have spent a lot of time talking with him., Attached: Document 315-a - A collection of relevant excerpts from interviews with [     ]-1.

        "text": " [     ] is a large, hardbound book with leather bindings. The paper inside resembles vellum and is written upon in black ink. The contents of the book consist entirely of a series of entries that describe apocalyptic events, which are not always XK-class end-of-the-world scenarios but invariably deal with the extinction of humanity. The entries are arranged in chronological order, beginning with an unexplained spontaneous failure of the sun in 6000 BC and ending with other events close to the present day. Many of the entries describe apocalypses caused or facilitated by objects that are or were in Foundation custody, or are of a paranormal nature. There are also records of human extinction caused by more \"conventional\" means, such as nuclear warfare or deadly viral epidemics. Each entry describes in some detail the events leading up to the calamity itself, and the aftermath until the point at which the last human on Earth dies., It has been observed that the entries in [     ] change to whatever language the reader is most comfortable with, up to the point where the sentence structure can change significantly from reader to reader, or even begin using colloquialisms that only the reader would understand; only the basic meaning of the entries remains constant. If multiple people are looking at [     ], it will read in the personal language of whomever began reading first. If no one is directly observing [     ], it will display the language of whomever read it last. Rarely, words will appear in the book that do not \"translate\" and instead appear as horizontally arranged calligraphic characters which have not been matched to any known language., To the best knowledge of Foundation historians, most of the information contained in [     ] is accurate, diverging only at the point where the apocalypse occurs. In almost all cases, the difference is that a few key decisions were apparently made differently in [     ]'s version of history, leading ultimately to humankind's annihilation., [     ] resists all attempts to change or write in it. Inks, graphite, charcoal, and other marking materials do not adhere to the pages, and are easily brushed off. Lasers or other heat sources do not burn into the paper. Close inspection has revealed that foreign substances are stopped from actually coming into contact with the pages: at least five (5) micrometers of empty space are always present between the pages themselves and any foreign materials that might come into contact with them. For this reason, [     ] does not decay, which also means that it has proven impossible to determine [     ]'s exact age., [     ] is self-updating, with newly-inked entries and new descriptions of how the last human died appearing at unpredictable intervals, always on the last page of the book; the date that a new entry appears corresponds with the date given in the entry for the death of the last member of the human species. When space becomes an issue, extra pages appear along with the text, and the spine of [     ] broadens accordingly. There have been \u2588\u2588\u2588 updates to the book since it came into Foundation custody. As with past events, [     ] has proven to be up-to-date on current events until a point at which a catastrophe occurs. Because recent entries frequently concern entities or groups of interest to the Foundation, including the Foundation itself, [     ] is to be checked regularly for any information of importance., Addendum 1: With the acknowledgment made that letting this thing lie around where the public could find it is dangerous to us, is there any real reason to study it? Outdated hypothetical disaster scenarios aren't our concern; we've got plenty of real ones in the present to deal with. -O5-\u2588, Addendum 2: The book is accurate enough about pre-disaster Earth that it makes a decent guide to the present. Plus, it gives a little perspective on the big picture of what some SCPs could do if they got loose. I think all researchers with clearance ought to read the last 50 pages or so just to drive home how important what they do here is. \"For want of a nail,\" and all that. -Dr. Jansen, Addendum 3: Jansen, half the entries in the last 50 pages show the Foundation screwing up and killing everybody. -O5-\u2588, Addendum 4: Like I said, it gives a little perspective. -Dr. Jansen, Incident Report 152-05: On the night of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the security guard on camera duty noticed that [     ] was missing from the reading room. However, by the time she had finished reaching for the switchboard to report this, [     ] had reappeared, and there was a new entry on the last page. As this was the fifth such occurrence of sudden disappearance and reappearance (refer to Incident Reports 152-01 through 152-04), a simple test was conducted with a high-speed camera, a sensitive electronic scale upon which [     ] was placed, and an alarm set to go off if the weight upon the scale abruptly changed. The next three \"updates\" to [     ] all set the alarm off, and the high-speed camera revealed that [     ] vanished from sight for exactly one (1) second each time., "

When it became apparent that none had, Dr. Graff requested and obtained funding and personnel to investigate the anomaly further., Addendum 1422-2: Information on the cause of and exact nature of [     ] is very limited.

[     ]'s most rudimentary form appears to be that of a single flame, comparable in size to that of a matchstick. In this form, [     ] possesses only the simplest of directives and shows no signs of being unusual compared to any other flame beyond a penchant for suddenly flickering to burn human hands, and the ability to 'jump' to more flammable materials or other flames, which it then assimilates into its total form., As [     ] grows larger, it is able to assume more complex shapes, and its intelligence grows with size and fuel sources.

This adaptation is theorized to have arisen in order to elude predators., [     ] was the largest species to have lived on Earth. Resembling spindly, vertically elongated giraffes or brachiosauruses, adults of the species grew to over 1,000 metres in height. They weighed no more than 4 tonnes, with most of their mass being \"camouflaged\" by a very similar adaptation.

Because of their height, they were visible on the horizon at this distance., Acquisition: Polynesian natives of the island of Maikiti used a substance called te\u00f9koka for recreational and religious purposes. As well as being a moderate psychedelic, this drug had mnestic properties, suppressing antimemetic effects and making entities camouflaged in this way easier to see and remember. Thus, the Maikitians were for hundreds of years the only people able to see [     ]. In Maikitian mythology [     ] were wandering spirits whom the gods had charged with maintaining the horizon, to ensure that the sky and the water never mixed. They were characterised as well-meaning and friendly, but unintelligent and often deficient in their duties, resulting in storms and typhoons. They were called polo'ongakau, \"the ones who walk very slowly\"., In 1991 an internal biochemistry study revealed that te\u00f9koka bore a strong chemical resemblance to the Foundation's own class-W mnestic.

Architecture is non-euclidean and the normal laws of gravity do not apply,5 thus inhabitants can be observed as climbing a stairway upside-down, but based on their own gravity source, they are climbing normally., The city has been described as having the odor of \"dried flowers with a hint of mold\", or a scent \"not unlike that of old books\". The actual size of the city has been difficult to measure but it appears to be located on an island, surrounded by a black ocean, the composition of the liquid is unknown but described as appearing more viscous than water., Operatives have reported a hypnagogic malaise while exploring [     ]-B, with difficulty estimating time and space. Although [     ]-B is a tangible location and not considered to be an actual dream, those who had a history of lucid dreaming have shown far greater self-control and attention to detail than those who did not. Operatives are to be reassigned and replaced monthly due to the threat of psychological addiction to [     ]-B. Initial efforts at exploration resulted in eight AWOL operatives with those that returned having difficulty describing what they had observed in a coherent and/or detailed manner., "

[     ] displays typical wear and tear and some indication that previous owners tried to pry the casing open unsuccessfully. The device is not indestructible and has responded to stress tests as expected. Disassembling and reassembling the device has revealed no anomalous parts or internal tampering. Cleaning and maintenance of its parts appears to have improved its accuracy but has not removed a blind spot that begins on the extreme right side of any screen it is aimed at., When [     ] is aimed and fired at any video screen, the user perceives that he or she has fired a shot into the displayed scene. Any physical object within the scene, whether live or previously recorded, will react appropriately in context. People who are shot will appear to die or be wounded, and other people in the scene will duck, take cover or flee off camera. It must be noted that this will not correspond with reality outside of the video and no one beyond the user of [     ] will perceive the change. Results will vary depending on the context of the video. Fictional characters in a television show will react consistently within the established parameters of their setting, while firing into news reports or documentaries will produce a realistic reaction. Therefore, shooting at an actor in an interview will produce a different result than shooting at the same actor who is currently portraying an invincible cyborg in a science fiction movie., Animated cartoons can also be affected, although \"cartoon logic\" produces wildly unpredictable results ranging from causing a character to momentarily be obscured by a puff of smoke and be covered with soot afterward, to [DATA EXPUNGED], The most notable result of use of [     ] is that it is permanent and can lead to very unusual experiences for the viewer. If a subject uses the device to shoot a character in a television series, they will forever perceive that they have changed the continuity of the series. A character will remain wounded or dead, and other characters will respond in context. This will continue even if [     ] is only used once and the viewer is never exposed to it again. At a certain threshold, fictional characters will begin to make broadly expositional statements to each other or through the \"fourth wall\" regarding the actions of the viewer, potentially divulging sensitive information.

Mr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 came to the attention of the SCP Foundation through posts on his fringe political blog, in which he had claimed to have assassinated then-President \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and then-Vice President \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, along with half of Congress, four members of the Supreme Court, and a wide range of news anchors, talk show hosts and political commentators. Questioning of the subject revealed that he never left the house and honestly believed the news reports he was watching and using [     ] upon were real. Mr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 claimed that he was using [     ] to stave off a military police state; however, using the device to \"assassinate\" so many high profile figures had the opposite effect on the video reality he was experiencing.

This, of course, had absolutely no effect on the agents who immediately took him into custody and seized [     ]. Under questioning, Mr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 said he had discovered the properties of [     ] when he idly aimed and fired it at an episode of the cartoon \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, when one of the main characters was wearing a graduate's cap and singing about geography. He claims that after the character recovered, it wagged a finger at him and specifically warned that the SCP Foundation was \"going to get him\" if he continued to fire the device before returning to its song., Mr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 perished while held in confinement.

The statue does not possess hands or facial features: the limbs taper off into rounded points and the head is a smooth surface all around. The default posture while under observation has the statue reaching upwards, head tilted as if facing the sky. Composition of the statue is currently undetermined; materials testing has yielded inconclusive and contradictory results., If the statue is not being observed, it will relocate itself to a point immediately behind whomever is in the containment site and assume a threatening posture. No noise is made during this relocation process, so the precise method of locomotion is as of yet unknown. The relocation point and posture are typically close enough to induce an automatic fight-or-flight response in the observer once they turn around and see it., However, it should be noted that the SCP has not yet shown any signs of active aggression or hostility. Based on trial responses that varied the amount of time between breaking and re-establishing line-of-sight, its purpose does not seem to be to attack but merely to startle. The reason for this is unknown, and no further research is pending to determine its motives., While the primary method appears to be triggering a startled reaction via close proximity, the SCP has also shown varied other postures in the presence of observers who have become used to its effects. In the cases of these observers, the statue has assumed other postures a comfortable distance away, including reclining on a table, \"sitting\" on a chair, and in one instance, huddled in a corner as if terrified. Given that the observers who reported these postures also mentioned that they were left feeling uneasy, it is theorized that this may simply be a secondary method of generating reactions., "

Opposite, there is a significant bulge, which is believed to store the majority of [     ]'s analysis equipment., There are several dish-shaped structures on [     ]'s surface that are presumed to be receivers for various forms of electromagnetic radiation, as well as lozenge-shaped capsules of unknown purpose. Several areas on its surface are broken, suggesting more appendages were once present., Biological components appear to have been grown over a mechanical frame, evidently designed to live in deep space. When observed, the entity seemed to have difficulty coping with temperatures much warmer than the Kuiper belt. Its surface temperature was 50 Kelvin when first found., [     ] was apparently once capable of interstellar travel, but most of its systems were damaged by an unknown event that left it stranded. Dating methods suggest it to have been at least 1.3 billion years old, though much of that time was spent dormant., The entity was almost entirely dormant when it was found. The only signs that it was active were faint lights running along its surface. Observation and experimentation showed that these were in response to radio waves. It had apparently been collecting signals for some time, but no sign of other functions could be detected until Foundation assets approached, at which point it began broadcasting., It was able to break Foundation decryption in less than one hour, at which point it began broadcasting binary signals in an attempt to communicate, starting with extremely simple mathematical concepts.

The device was discovered in 1946, and recovered from a defunct but heavily secured research facility utilized by Tesla in [REDACTED] during 1934., [     ] consists of three components, the interface ([     ]-1), the accelerator ([     ]-2), and the core ([     ]-3)., [     ]-1 is a steel control console featuring a QWERTY keyboard, a 23cm x 23cm display screen, and a number of buttons, switches, and levers. [     ]-1 is connected to [     ]-2 and [     ]-3 by a network of copper wiring. The display screen features a command-based operating system, with commands and responses appearing in green block text. The nature of [     ]-1's operating system is still under investigation., [     ]-2 is believed to be a linear particle accelerator, held in a lead-lined tungsten cylindrical chamber. The device contains all the components that would be required for a contemporary particle accelerator, though it is significantly smaller (7.35 meters in length) than a device of this design would require. Please see Document-[     ]-2 for full information on the individual components of the accelerator., [     ]-3, identified as the \"core\" in Tesla's schematics, is a lead-lined tungsten assembly containing an apparatus of currently unclear function. This apparatus, which is observable via a silica glass view-port, consists of a spherical frame constructed of an unidentified substance. This frame is approximately 10\u00a0cm in diameter and suspended within a transparent sphere, the composition of which also remains unidentified. According to Tesla's notes, the space within this sphere is held in a perpetual vacuum state. Present within the frame is a continuous current of plasma, generated and perpetuated by unknown means., Available information suggests that particles produced in [     ]-3 would then be introduced into [     ]-2 and accelerated as expected for such a device. Energetic particles would then be propelled from the terminus of [     ]-2 toward the intended target. How the device is powered, and the exact nature of the particles produced by [     ]-3, remains unclear., Item #: [     ], Object Class: Keter, Special Containment Procedures: The above falsified document is to be made available for all personnel without 4/2700 Clearance., [     ]'s containment vault is located 180 meters from the surface level entrance to Secure Bunker-\u2588\u2588\u2588. The vault itself is to be insulated against seismic activity and safeguarded by three (3) sets of reinforced steel doors. Access to the vault is forbidden barring semi-hourly inspection, unless there is risk of an imminent containment failure and contingency procedures are necessary. All personnel entering the vault are to be equipped with batrachotoxin collars, which are to be activated for any breach of protocol., [     ] is to remain under constant surveillance, and all data regarding the state of [     ]-Omega is to be updated semi-hourly. Personnel tasked with accessing [     ]-1's operating system must adhere to a set of guidelines present in Document-[     ]-1. There is to be no direct interaction with [     ]-3 barring unanimous approval of the O5 Council; breaches of this protocol warrant immediate termination. Any change in the behavior of [     ]-Omega must be reported immediately, as such activity could result in a YK-Class Event., Personnel assigned to the containment of [     ] are to investigate all available material related to the origin and function of [     ]. The primary objective in regards to the artifact's containment is to be its deactivation prior to the occurrence of a YK-Class Event. In light of the catastrophic severity a possible breach by [     ] presents, Statute-30-A may be waived by personnel with 5/2700 Clearance: proposals for the cross-neutralization of [     ] utilizing other SCP objects (including those of Keter class) may be presented to the O5 Council for evaluation., In the event of imminent containment failure, [     ]-3 is to be disposed of via the currently approved cross-neutralization SCP object., Description: [     ] is a device originally constructed by Nikola Tesla with the purpose of producing a directed-energy weapon. Investigation of the artifact while in Foundation custody, however, has proven that [     ] possesses a function distinct from and significantly more dangerous than its original designs., [     ]-1 and [     ]-2 are as described in the above document, however [     ]-3 is not. The luminescent anomaly located in the center of [     ]-3 is not plasma, as previously indicated, but a discrete energy phenomenon now designated [     ]-Omega. [     ]-Omega behaves inversely with regards to entropy: the energy state within its boundaries constantly moves from thermal equilibrium to thermal singularity, from disorganized to organized. In other words, the flow of energy moves from the state of maximum entropy to minimal entropy, which is opposite to the standard for the rest of the universe. Due to this, the effective flow of time within this region is also reversed. Presently the unidentified materials surrounding the region (the frame and transparent sphere) are immune to the effects of [     ]-Omega; this appears to be the only factor preventing a breach of the phenomenon., If [     ]-Omega were to escape the interior of [     ]-3, an inexorable chain-reaction would occur, converting the rest of the universe to this inverted entropic state. The eventuality of this scenario would be a YK-Class Entropic Annihilation Event, resulting in the reduction of the entire universe to an infinitely energetic singularity (ostensibly an inverted Big Bang)., As indicated by [     ]-1, the device is currently armed and set to activate in 2234 (exactly three hundred years after its initial arming). As this would inherently trigger a breach of [     ]-Omega, current containment protocols must be completed prior to the set date to avert a YK-Class Event., "

The pool appears to have been fabricated from common Earth plastics but has shown itself to be indestructible by any attempted means (see research report #120-32 for a full summary). The pool\u2019s structure and response to pressure are typical for such a pool (it will flex when pressure is applied and is soft to the touch) but has amazing tensile strength and cannot be permanently stretched or ripped., What is contained within the pool seems to be a brightly glowing, coloured, liquid-like substance, which seems to exist only partially in our dimension. It is unresponsive to manipulation by organic or inorganic means, but the substance ripples and shimmers systematically and regularly, suggesting it exists physically on another dimension., [     ]\u2019s most interesting and useful property is used regularly by Foundation personnel. Human beings, when alive and carrying loads (including clothing) under 37.8 kilograms, are observed to fall through the pool, and are deposited at one of 11 destinations. These will be detailed in an addendum., The item will only function in this way if certain conditions are met: the subject must be genetically human; the subject must be conscious; the subject must be carrying weights of under the specified amount; and only one subject must be present on the surface. Test subjects attempting to use [     ] while these conditions were not met reported their feet making contact with a smooth surface underneath the liquid but no significant effects were observed., [     ]\u2019s main use is as a potential means of evacuation for Command-\u2588\u2588 during a major emergency. It is currently stored and maintained in a fortified outbuilding of this facility. To inspect evacuation procedures, refer to document #120-22., [     ] was first brought to the attention of Foundation authorities on 31/08/1992. Local police authorities in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, California, were investigating reports of missing children in their jurisdiction, and discovered and reported the item on 31/08. Overwatch Command was automatically informed through the usual channels, and a small team of Foundation agents was dispatched to claim and transport the item to Site-19, where it remained for testing over the next 2 years., It was transferred to its present location at Command-\u2588\u2588 in 1994., Addendum:, Document #120-7: Destructive test results for [     ] \u2013 24/12/1993 [Abridged version], Document #120-10: Detailed explanation of [     ]\u2019s capabilities and destinations \u2013 12/02/1994 [Abridged version], [     ] possesses the capability of instant translocation of human beings, possibly through one or more alternate dimensions. Subjects using the item are invariably deposited at one of 11 locations. These locations cycle in a specific and unchanging pattern. The 11 destinations and their locations were determined through testing with Class-D personnel carrying radio beacons. They are detailed here:, Location 1: Pacific Ocean: [     ]\u2019s liquid displays a blue glow while connected to this destination., Subjects attempting travel to this destination are deposited an average of 2 metres above the surface of the Pacific at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0S, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0W.

Class-D personnel used to \u201cdial\u201d [     ] can be confined and extracted by helicopter or reused, or simply terminated and their bodies retained in storage., The original Class D and radio transmitter used to determine this location were lost at sea, and might have to be recovered in the interest of secrecy, if they were to wash up on populated shores., This configuration of [     ] was arbitrarily designated as #1, and has no observable significance above other configurations. Destinations 2 through 11 follow in sequential order after this configuration, and return to it after a full cycle., Travel by [     ] to this location is not advisable during storms due to risk of injury., Location 2: Greenland: [     ] displays a bright white glow while dialed to this destination., Subjects travelling to this destination materialize 1.5 metres above the surface of Greenland, at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N and longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0W. A small facility was established here, under the public pretense of oil industry expansion. This facility has similar capabilities and use to the Demeter, and is additionally equipped with an airstrip and refueling facilities., Location 3: L3: Located at the Earth-Moon Lagrange Point 3. The SCP displays a deep black colour., Objects and personnel sent through the SCP to any Lagrange point (locations 3, 5, 8, 10, and 11) are effectively lost, as retrieval is impossible at our current level of technology. They may prove a possible way to remove small but threatening SCP objects, but for now, are merely an inconvenience, as sacrifice of D-personnel is required to move the SCP to its next configuration., Location 4: Himalayas: [     ] displays a white glow similar to when it is dialed to Location 2., Materialization occurs at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E, on a mountain in the Himalayan mountain range. Only minor changes have been made to the destination: the digging of an 8-metre hole for disposal of D-class bodies, an overhead canopy for concealment, and supplies and tenting for evacuation to this location (which should only take place in extreme circumstances)., D-class personnel used for dialing are to be injected with a mixture of sedatives and neurotoxin before sending, to ensure a humane death and decrease risk of damage to the structures at Location 4., Location 5: L5: Identical to Location 3., Location 6: Sahara: [     ] will glow yellow., Personnel materialize at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E in a small outpost. The need for secrecy renders this facility unable to house any significant SCP object, but is ideal for evacuation of personnel and documents from Command., Location 7: Gobi: [     ] displays a brown glow., This destination is located at a small outpost in the Gobi desert, latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E, but is otherwise identical to the location 6 outpost., Location 8: L2: Identical to Location 3, although shows more potential for SCP disposal, being situated beyond the moon., Location 9: Mare Imbrium: The SCP displays a subdued grey glow when dialed in to this destination., This destination is on a relatively flat section of the Sea of Rains on the lunar surface. Through vast expenditure of money and D-class personnel, a small outpost has been established there, and is considered one of the Foundation\u2019s safest locations., Location 10: L4: Identical to Location 3., "

The light emitted by each lamp behaves in a manner unique to [     ] and passes completely through any surface that is not colored white. Once the light contacts a white surface it scatters and reflects as normal and loses any unnatural properties. If the light continues uninterrupted through any matter, otherwise casting no shadow, each lamp will display an unidentified young woman's shadow upon any flat white surface, such as the projection screen in Chamber 52. Whether or not this shadow corresponds to anyone living or dead has yet to be determined, although the shadow appears to re-enact a specific series of events leading up to the woman's death., Even if the lamps are slightly moved, the shadow remains distinct and does not lose focus or move along with the one lamp or the other. Only one shadow is cast although a physical person standing before two lamps would actually cast two shadows., When supplied with steady power and maintained, the [     ] pair will go through a six month cycle that ends on April 30th and October 31st of each year. Neither the inclusion of an extra day during a Leap Year nor intermittent operation failures change these dates, thus [     ]'s cycle appears to be tied to the standard calendar rather than a set passage of time., [     ] will shut off at midnight on the final day of each cycle. Any persons entering or already inside Chamber 52 when the lamps are both turned off are violently assaulted by forces unseen in a manner consistent with the fate suffered by the shadow woman, regardless of any other light sources in the room., If the lamps are shut off at the end of a standard six month cycle they can be remotely activated to immediately end the danger and begin a new cycle. If the lamps cease operating for any other reason Chamber 52 will remain dangerous and must remain sealed for at least thirty days regardless of the status of [     ] itself. During a dangerous phase any equipment in the room is often ransacked, but although [     ] itself has sometimes been moved the lamps are never damaged., On two occasions [DATA EXPUNGED] were carved into the walls. This strongly implies that [DATA EXPUNGED] displaying an awareness of current containment procedures., Overview of [     ]'s cycle: For the first month of operation, [     ] will display a still image of one woman in a provocative pose. Although variances have been noted in the pose and clothing of the woman, the individual displayed appears to be distinct and consistent through all cycles. During the last week of the first month, the shadow will begin to move slightly as if the individual is shifting her weight or becoming uncomfortable. Her hair and clothing will be observed to flutter in ways that do not correspond to any movement of the atmosphere within Chamber 52. By the end of the first calendar month the shadow will break her pose and spend the next eight hours moving through a series of poses that imply a photography session complete with clothing changes and short breaks, sometimes including a meal., After this session is over the shadow will constantly be in motion for the next five months, displaying a pantomime of the last days of a young model's life before she is brutally murdered at the end of the cycle. The shadow of the woman never moves beyond the boundaries of the projection screen. The shadows of objects that the woman appears to be interacting with do not appear unless they are being picked up or carried, and with the exception of the final month of the cycle any other individuals that the shadow appears to be interacting with are not seen., Although the cycle is slightly different each time certain consistencies are observed. The individual portrayed appears to have taken up photography as a hobby in addition to being a fashion model. Her behavior implies a great deal of social interaction although with a lack of intimacy and behavior that indicates living alone rather than with family or a partner. One implied sexual encounter with an unseen partner occurs in the second or third month of the cycle and exactly sixty six explicit sexual encounters occur in the final month of the cycle., During the last month of the cycle in April and October, shadows distinct from the young woman are displayed. These shadows all have exaggerated nude male physiques and horns projecting from the cranium although no phallus is ever observed, even during the sexual displays that take up the final days of the cycle. Only one shadow appears at first, interacting with the woman in a manner suggesting that they have met at a party or social gathering. The woman does not appear to notice the unusual nature of the other shadow and plays out a series of varying romantic interactions with it. The horned shadow will return to dine with the woman, engage in silent conversations and accompany her on outings. One recurring event involves the horned shadow introducing the woman to at least two other identical horned figures. After the second week of the month the woman will take photographs of one or more of the horned shadows during one of their outings, always with a non-digital camera that has been consistent through all observed viewings of the [     ] cycle. After this event explicit sexual encounters will begin between the woman and one of the figures, increasing in intensity and frequency until the end of the third week., During the final week of the month the woman appears to develop the film in her camera for the first time since photographing the horned shadow(s). Her reaction to the photographs is one of shock and horror, and her movements afterward suggest that she attempts to flee and seek shelter behind a locked door, presumably in her home. There she is encountered by multiple instances of the horned shadow figure which assault her repeatedly for the remainder of the week. It is strongly implied that she is killed during this process although the assaults will continue until the end of the cycle., On the last day of the cycle one of the horned shadows begins to grow larger in a manner suggesting that the figure casting it is approaching the [     ] lamps directly. It will eventually overcast all other shadows and at this time both lamps will be physically turned off regardless of any modifications made to prevent a halt in operation., Addendum: [     ]-1 has been in the Foundation's possession since \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588; [     ]-2 is identical in every way, including the serial number.

Initial testing of the ride resulted in extremely negative experiences from testing staff. When these reports became public knowledge, the financial repercussions of the \"failure\" of the Steelsurfer resulted in the parent company of the amusement park going bankrupt. The property was abandoned and undisturbed until 19\u2588\u2588, when a local gang broke into the park and reactivated the improperly-disabled rides, [     ] included.

(For more information, see Archive.112.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588). Suspecting the ride had traits within its mandate, the Foundation purchased the park (under the auspices of rebuilding the park as Amusatastic Land) in order to test any potential anomalous properties from the ride., When [     ] is started, the ride functions as expected until Point Alpha, its primary drop. When a car reaches Point Alpha, the train vanishes. After 3 minutes (the estimated time the train would normally take), the train rematerializes at Point Omega (3\u00a0m from the coaster's starting point), Human subjects riding [     ] have a drastically different experience compared to outside observation. The time-frame between Point Alpha and Point Omega is massively extended, with subjective ride times ranging from 4 minutes to \u2588 months. The properties of the ride also vary from person to person. Most subjects report elements on the ride that do not exist on the ride proper, like batwings, cobra rolls, and inclined loops. Subjects do not have any sense that the rest of the world is alien or otherwise different; only the ride experience is different., Upon exiting the ride, subjects typically experience feelings of confusion and ill health, depending on the subjective time they spent riding [     ]. These feelings are based not on any physical maladies but the subjective experience of dealing with a physical malady for an extended period of time. For example, a subject with a subjective ride time of three days may experience confusion that he had strong feelings of hunger for most of his ride, but at the end of the ride he was not hungry at all., Addendum-A: Assorted Experiments:, Experiment 11234534, Experiment 11267564, Experiment 1125893, Experiment 1127556, Addendum-B: Rider Interviews, Experiment 112-35784-23512, Post-Ride Interview #1, "

[     ]'s face is entirely obscured by the hood of its parka and what appears to be an oversized pair of opaque black mountain goggles. [     ] has never been observed to wear any other clothes. As very few living people have observed [     ] except through a telescope, it is not known whether its coverings are clothes or part of its body, or what it may look like underneath (except as per Interview 1529-1.), The Foundation became aware of [     ] in the 1970s when annual expeditions to the summit of Mt. Everest became commonplace, and rumors began to circulate in the mountaineering community about a \"monster\" near the summit. Photographs found undeveloped in George Mallory's1 camera after the discovery of his remains in 1999 indicate that [     ] was present and active by the time of his attempt on the summit, and was not then significantly different in appearance than it is today. (Foundation media assets have reported that Mallory's camera was never found, and that his death was the result of a fall.), During periods when daylight is sufficient and cloud cover allows for surveillance of the mountain, [     ] is on average observable \u2588\u2588% of the time. For \u2588\u2588% of that time, [     ] is \"inactive\", and lies or sits motionless. Recorded periods of inactivity have extended from 17 minutes to (possibly) 8 months; median period of inactivity is 23.4 days. When \"active\", [     ] can be observed to climb about the upper reaches of the mountain and summit in no discernible direction. [     ] has never been observed to use any tools or climbing aids other than its hands or feet, and while travelling along established climbing routes will ignore the existence of guide ropes or ladders that have been installed by previous climbers. [     ] has demonstrated an ability to climb or descend sections of the mountain's face believed impassable to conventional mountaineers, has never been observed to fall or lose its grip, and is seemingly unencumbered by sub-zero temperatures, high winds, thin air, or low atmospheric pressure. The cause of its becoming active or inactive is unknown, and shows no correlation to weather, time of day, traffic up the mountain, season, or time of year. [     ] has never been observed to descend below the 8,000 meter mark (except as per Incident 1529-1.) Documented periods of activity have extended from 3 hours to (possibly) 6 days; median documented period is 15.2 hours. Nighttime observation of [     ] has thus far proved impossible. Infrared imaging has shown no difference in temperature between [     ] and the surrounding mountainside., If human climbers ascend past the 8,000 meter mark while [     ] is active, it will attempt to make its way towards them and interpose itself between them and the summit or camp. [     ] seems to prefer to target solo climbers or climbers that are significantly ahead of or behind the rest of their group, but will target individuals within a group if such an opportunity does not present itself. Once [     ] is within eyesight of a traveller it will attempt to gain his/her attention and cause the traveller to make eye contact with it, which induces a hypnotic effect in the victim.

It came to the Foundation's attention after several disappearances in the area were linked to visits to the abandoned building., The building demonstrates spatial anomalies. Its internal space is much greater than the external surface of the building would allow. Hallways display variable length, while stairways have differing numbers of steps going up or down. The number of rooms off the hallways changes each time they are counted. Attempts to reach the far ends of the hallways have met with failure thus far. Entrance through the fire escapes located at the ends of the hallways leads to doors approximately midway down the length of the halls., EDIT: See Note 026-A, There is considerable graffiti on the interior walls of the school. Most appears typical, including gang signs, names, and street art. However, the graffiti fades and reappears, changing location. Writing on chalkboards and bulletin boards changes in a similar fashion.

One researcher reported one board detailing information about SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, but photographic evidence showed only a blank slate (See Note 026-B). The phrase \"The children used to sing\" has appeared multiple times in various places throughout the building, but there is currently no explanation for its significance., A number of unconscious subjects have been found in the building, mostly of high school age, ranging from twelve to eighteen. They are dressed in accordance to the school's dress code, circa \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Several have been identified as former students or faculty of the school who disappeared after the school shut down (in at least one case, more than ten years after the closure).

Cryptanalysis showed that the trades formed an intelligible message in a simple code. An investigation by MTF-Phi-1 (\"Hostile Takeover\") into brokers and computers at the company demonstrated no awareness of the signals being sent on the part of any member of staff or any anomalous activity from computers, and recommended that further study was warranted., After a decade of intensive study, encompassing interviews with staff, multiple detailed audits and computer-aided analysis of patterns of asset purchases and capital transfers, it was postulated by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that [     ] comprises a fully sentient, sapient entity, capable of informed decision making and responses to its environment., At the time of writing, [     ] employs \u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 people and has an annual revenue of $\u2588.\u2588\u2588 billion USD.

It is theorised that [     ]'s mind arises from and runs on the collective and aggregated actions of the corporation itself, encompassing not only a subset of the actions of staff, shareholders and directors but also the movements of capital, goods, information and legal instruments., Given the above, analysis of the \"mind\" of [     ] is a challenging and subtle task, comparable in complexity to reading a human mind based purely on scans of neurological activity. This has strongly hampered efforts to establish [     ]'s effective level of intelligence, memory, typical emotional responses, and speed of cognition; however, it is assumed the latter is many orders of magnitude slower than the human norm owing to the nature of the cognitive substrate (i.e., human actions)., Not all actions performed by employees form part of [     ]'s cognition. Instead, [     ] appears to exploit the existence of routine, semi-conscious and habitual behaviour by its employees for this purpose, especially amongst entry-level employees., Employees experience their behaviour as freely-willed, but are unusual in reporting higher levels of job satisfaction than the statistical baseline for their economic sector; staff interviews typically feature self-reports of high levels of motivation, strong interpersonal relationships while at work, and a sense of \"being part of something larger\"., Communication attempts by [     ], referred to as instances of [     ]-1, are made over the course of several months, and are targeted at seemingly random corporations. These messages are sent via the medium of high-frequency stock trading. Communication is one-way: there is no evidence [     ] has ever received a response to any of its messages. All messages contain a preamble attempting to establish the sentience of the sender (typically beginning with a sequence of prime numbers or the digits of pi) and a code in which to communicate. Despite the months-long process, the unique intelligible informational content of each message is brief, forming short sentences or sentence fragments, typically in English (although [     ] has been seen to attempt other languages when communicating with multinational or foreign corporations)., As yet, [     ] has made no confirmed attempts at communication with human beings. Its perception of and attitude toward humanity both remain unclear., "

[     ]-2 does not appear to have mass or inertia, and appears only to be visible due to refraction of light passing through it, and because of [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in Cherenkov radiation of varying intensity. Any physical object with mass that comes in contact with [     ]-2 will suffer an instantaneous change in velocity and direction away from [     ]-2 without any loss in energy. This is apparently caused by being reflected through a higher-order spatial dimension. If the affected mass is in a solid phase, this reflection will cause a change in topology that can result in either an inversion (turning inside out), a reflection (mirroring of all or part of physical structure), or a [DATA EXPUNGED] and high levels of gamma radiation., Because of these characteristics, it is currently impossible to directly affect [     ]-2 with any means currently at the Foundation\u2019s disposal.

[     ]-2 will enter an active state and begin random erratic movements orbiting the location of [     ]-1. Average distance from [     ]-1 will increase, and the apparent volume of [     ]-2 will also increase. The rate of increase in both distance and size appears to undergo a geometric progression over time, and neither has been observed to decrease. This behavior will cease once [     ]-1 is again sufficiently illuminated, at which point [     ]-2 will cease motion at whatever location it is at that moment, and remain there fixed in relation to [     ]-1. The threshold for this effect currently appears to be between 500 and 650 lux, and it appears that this threshold may increase by approximately \u2588\u2588% whenever [     ]-2 enters an active state., Because of [     ]-2\u2019s interaction with normal matter, an active state is considered extremely dangerous.

Bodfel III (b. 1866 - d. 1952)1 - millionaire industrialist with an acute interest in the occult. Prior to his death, Bodfel was the leader of a secret society known as Adytum's Wake. Dismissed by the Foundation in 1932 as simply being a \"decadent upper-class social club\", their anomalous capabilities were not recognized until the November 28, 1952 incident., Due to the critical failure of their mission, there were no surviving GOC operatives to be properly interrogated. However, documents were subsequently recovered from a GOC safe house located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It appears that the GOC attempted to destroy these documents prior to their mission. A torn report (lower half missing) with a photograph attached via paperclip was discovered in the back of a fireplace along with significant ash. It is assumed that all other documents had been incinerated., It is theorized has been verified that GOC operatives intended to assassinate PoI-93. As PoI-93 was not discovered among the dead, it can be surmised that the GOC did not achieve their primary goal. The Foundation became aware of [     ] after intercepting and decoding a GOC distress broadcast, promptly sending an investigative team. Thirty-six corpses were found scattered throughout the estate; eight of which were later identified as GOC operatives. All but five6 displayed anomalous cause of death such as implosion, disintegration, and fatal physical reconfiguration., [     ] is hypothesized to be a dimensional anomaly that cannot be directly perceived. This cognitohazardous effect interferes with perception in such a way that only through the use of perception altering chemicals and / or the direct and sustained observation of its effects on local reality it may be detected. Reality alterations were subtle and restricted to Bodfel Manor - manifesting as impossible interior dimensions (interior larger than exterior would suggest, non-Euclidian architecture, and additional rooms and corridors that did not previously exist)., [     ] has been classified as safe., "

The rate at which human perception of [     ] increases is directly related to the rate at which [     ] undergoes systemic biological decay, and the number of individuals who are cognizant of [     ]'s nature is inversely related to its overall size and strength. This effect, however, is not instant, and seems to take place over the course of several hours after initial cognition. While it is believed that [     ] could feasibly continue to decrease in size indefinitely, the limits of this effect, if any, are unknown., "

Should two subjects with contrasting desires both be photographed together, the subjects' desires appear to 'mix' (see testing log for additional information)., Addendum:, Subjects are allowed to request photographs of themselves. Remember, people, just because some of the photos show distasteful things doesn't mean that you're going to do them. ~ Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Testing Log, "

        "text": " [     ] is a resin model of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701, resembling the ship of the same name from the 1966 American television show, Star Trek. It measures approximately 28 centimeters in length at its longest point. It includes a battery enclosure (currently empty) with a removable cover, and a black plastic display stand., Materials testing has revealed that the main bulk of the model is a solid mass of polyoxymethylene, laced with trace amounts of various heavy metals, including some radioactive isotopes (which have not been observed to lose mass as they decay,) as well as traces of Cibacron F Scarlet dye and human DNA., [     ]'s primary anomalous effect occurs when the ship is removed from its stand. Subjects handling the ship report auditory hallucinations consistent with the main theme of the original Star Trek television series, as well as various iconic sound effects reminiscent of the show. If the ship is then placed onto any object in the room other than its stand, the room containing [     ] undergoes a Landing Event, as outlined below., In an [     ] Landing Event, the room containing [     ] becomes \"separated\" from the facility, appearing black and impenetrable and emitting no radiation, except for a constant surface temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, and radio waves, which propagate normally between the interior of the room and the surrounding area. This makes it possible for researchers to communicate with test subjects inside the room during a Landing Event., Subjects in the room with [     ] during a Landing Event likewise no longer perceive the outside world, other than the aforementioned behavior of radio waves. Instead, beyond the door and any windows, subjects report vistas of alien worlds, often corresponding either visually or thematically with the object [     ] was placed upon. Furthermore, placing [     ] on similar objects often results in the room \"visiting\" the same world in successive tests. Examples of worlds that can be reliably accessed in this manner include:, Please refer to Document 2063-LE-L for a comprehensive list of worlds visited to date., Subjects within the room during a Landing Event can exit the room normally, walk around on the extraterrestrial landscape, and even retrieve objects and artifacts. However, all foreign objects so retrieved dissolve without trace within 20 seconds after the termination of the Landing Event., A Landing Event terminates when [     ] is picked up again by a human subject, or when all subjects affected by the Landing Event have been terminated. Upon termination of a Landing Event, the room is again visible and physically accessible from its original location on Earth., It should be noted that D-class personnel tend to have a high mortality rate during Landing Events. For reasons that are not well-understood (but which have been heavily speculated upon by researchers,) D-class personnel are invariably the first to be terminated by dangers present. Test groups comprised exclusively of researchers tend to fare better, although fatalities can still occur. It has been noted that when a mixed group of researchers and D-class participate in the same Landing Event, subjects other than D-class usually emerge unscathed. For this reason, it is recommended that at least one D-class personnel accompany any researcher or group of researchers wishing to study a Landing Event firsthand., [     ]'s secondary anomalous properties manifest when approximately 70 days have elapsed without the object being handled, or when [     ] perceives a \"threat\" to itself. In these situations, [     ] becomes autonomous, and will detach from the stand of its own volition. It behaves in a manner similar to spaceships depicted on the show, flying around the room without apparent regard to gravity or momentum, emitting sweeps of radiation out to 2 meters in what is presumed to be active scanning, projecting a visible \"shield\" around the ship, and discharging energy weapons at threats, out to a maximum range of one meter., Targets have included a pair of wire cutters held by a researcher, a Rockwell-type hardness tester, the emitter of a 4000 watt CO2 cutting laser, and most of a D-class personnel who, unprompted, attempted to unscrew the main sensor array., The intelligence of [     ] is a subject of ongoing study, but at this point appears to be quite limited. It does not seem to associate existent threats, such as Destructive Testing tools, with the individuals holding or operating those tools. In general, it will raise its shields immediately when it detects a \"threat,\" vaporize any part of that threat coming within 1 meter of it, and then lower its shields after the threat has been neutralized or has been out of \"scanning range\" for approximately 5 minutes. It will fly around the inside of its enclosure, but will generally not attempt to pass through open doors, exhibiting behavior similar to that observed in some species of fish when a glass partition is removed from their tank., However, it is emphasized that the Foundation first became aware of [     ]'s autonomous behavior when it used its energy weapons to cut its way out of the High-Value Materials Storage Locker in which it had been stored for more than 70 days. (Refer to Incident Report 2063-02 for details.) Up until this point, [     ] had been classified as Safe. Due to the projected difficulty of reestablishing containment should [     ] ever seriously attempt a breach, current Containment Procedures are designed to reduce the likelihood of any unscheduled autonomous activity manifesting in the first place., On 9/08/12, [     ] began transmitting the Fibonacci sequence. It has not, however, responded to any Foundation attempts to communicate. The resurgence of this transmission is often one of the first signs of autonomous activity when the object has not been handled for more than 70 days., "

There is also a large quantity of human remains in the complex, particularly concentrated around the entry/exit portal, with the corpses of Nazi officials, military personnel, Hitler Youth, and civilians (possibly Ukrainian slave workers) in an advanced state of decay. Evidence of a firefight near the entry/exit portal supports the hypothesis that the German military personnel were swarmed by the civilians and were killed in the ensuing struggle.

A production line exists which would allow damaged fighters and deliveries to enter on one side of the hangar door, and finished fighters to exit on the other side. Turning the endoscope head 180 degrees reveals the open doorway as an area of total blackness with two nostril-shaped penetrations in it. One nostril-shaped penetration is connected to whichever nostril is admitting the endoscope, and the other is connected to the interior of a human nasal cavity. DNA testing reveals the nasal cavity belongs to the subject. The black area is impenetrable and absorbs all wavelengths of light that the endoscope can carry.

The transition location is classified as a SSUIS2 (Stable/Stationary/Unaided/Instantaneous/Safe/Two Way) universal overlap., [     ]\u2019s environment is most notable in its overall lack of surface ice. The majority of the continent consists of a central BWh desert region, interspersed with seasonal rivers and lakes. Vegetation is sparse, and primarily consists of coastal forests and scrubland. Agriculture is carried out during the summer months through a complex series of irrigation canals and large plantations, taking advantage of glacial melts., The average summer temperature is approximately 35\u00b0 C (95\u00b0 F), with winter temperatures reaching -35\u00b0 C (-31\u00b0 F). The cause of this temperature, and the implications on the rest of the planet's climate, are unknown at this time. Many species of native life bear no resemblance to Baseline species, and several have been specially bred or otherwise modified by [     ]-1. There is no indication of biological cross contamination between [     ] and Baseline: similarities are the result of convergent evolution., The sapient inhabitants of [     ] are designated as [     ]-1, Homo antarcticus. The exact lineage of the species is unknown at this time, though the last shared ancestor with H. sapiens is considered to be the B-10208-Alpha-1483 instance of H. heidelbergensis. A single sub-species and numerous racial variants exist, as well as several clades formed by the application of specific anomalous properties to certain populations., See Addendum-02 for a listing of major clades of [     ]-1., [     ] is currently unified under the Third Antarctic Empire,2 a matriarchal imperialist monarchy overseeing seventeen dependent provinces. Provincial governments are answerable to a central regulatory bureaucracy operating out of the capital. The current imperial government was founded in 1526 CE, and is the third such ruling body to unify the continent. Records prior to year 2-151 (553 CE)3 are both rare and generally inaccurate., The Empire\u2019s technology level is roughly equivalent to that of 20th century Baseline, with certain exceptions. Nuclear, geothermal, and solar power are more prevalent energy sources than fossil fuels, while communication and aerospace technologies lag behind the Baseline significantly. Wired telecommunications and primitive computing systems are extant only within developed areas. The majority of the population of [     ] resides in urban centers connected by a train network, or large plantation settlements. Most settlements contain subterranean districts for inhabitation during the winter months. Mainstream Imperial culture is a highly stratified, female-dominated class system, though regional variants or throwbacks to older cultural structures exist in outlying areas., The existence of anomalous objects is common knowledge within the Empire, officially dealt with by the Imperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study and military force as necessary. The Foundation is treated as a public ward of the IIPES. The Foundation\u2019s presence and purpose in [     ] is tolerated by Imperial authorities: However, the Foundation is limited to operations within authorized areas. Access to sealed records, specific information regarding items under the Institute\u2019s control, and any information deemed sensitive by the Empire or IIPES is likewise limited., See Addendum-01 for a listing of major anomalous objects under Imperial control., When questioned about regions outside of the borders of [     ], an Imperial liaison responded: \u201cThe dealings of savages and their rotting lands are of no concern to us.

Furthermore, most infectees exhibit dramatically increased appetite, as well as decreased aversion to unhygienic practices. Experimentation has confirmed that [     ] infectees lack a satiety response, enabling them to consume far in excess of normal human capacities., [     ] infectees have been observed to coordinate gatherings of up to approximately two hundred infected individuals. These gatherings have been recorded to last for up to a week. Infectees employed in food service professions often use their positions to deliver large quantities of food to the gathering place in order to facilitate near-constant food consumption. Due to inadequate waste disposal facilities and infectee disregard for cleanliness, sanitation suffers dramatically. Infection and disease, sometimes resulting in death, are common. Infectees typically burn the bodies of the deceased., [     ] infection vectors are distributed throughout the internet and mass media by an unknown source.

As such, restraint or sedation can be necessary in order to provide nutritionally sustainable amounts of food, water, and medical care. Due to repeated and excessive strain brought about by the carving behavior, instances of [     ] can suffer from chipped or cracked beaks, infections, strained muscles in the neck, dehydration and malnutrition, and in some cases, death.

During containment, subject produced three utterances in an unknown Southern Semitic language, but otherwise made no attempts to communicate with Foundation staff. Food, water, and bedding were declined. Intravenous nutrition proved impossible. Subject otherwise exhibited no anomalous behavior. For autopsy results, consult Document [     ]-SMR-9., [     ]-02 is a ritual practice of unknown provenance. Spoken portions of [     ]-02 are performed in an unknown Southern Semitic language. When adequately performed by individuals meeting unclear ritual criteria, [     ]-02 prevents full retraction of the veil surrounding [     ]-03, an obligatory precursor event in scenarios XK-734, XK-918, and XK-337. At present, details of the religious faith underlying [     ]-02, ritual criteria necessary for adequate participation in [     ]-02, and the causal mechanism connecting [     ]-02 with the retraction of the veil are speculative or unknown., When performed by appropriate celebrants, adequate performances of [     ]-02 are memetically virulent, inducing suggestibility, religious mania, and desire to perform the ritual practice in 38% of exposures. Repeated exposure results in ritually-themed obsessive compulsion. The memetic transmission rate of [     ]-02 appears to increase as successive revisions approach the ideal state. For unknown reasons, members of haplotype CMH-6 appear to be immune to the adverse effects of this memetic transference. While present transcripts and recordings of [     ]-02 are not believed to be virulent, existing containment guidelines require certified Foundation linguists to minimize active exposure to full ritual recordings., [     ]-03 is the central chamber of the [     ] complex. Due to high neutron flux, the chamber was originally believed to be a storage site for high-grade radioactive waste or an unshielded reactor core. Initial investigation of the chamber by remote drone revealed an elaborate rectangular chamber, decorated in a proto-Semitic style. Repeated motifs include rams, serpents, slaughtered bulls, wounded lions, hawks, and depictions of ritual practices similar to [     ]-02. In the center of the room is a raised platform with a 9 meter radius, surrounded by cylindrical sheath constructed of beryllium bronze. At dawn, noon, and dusk, the sheath retracts, causing neutron flux inside [     ]-03 to increase to lethal levels. Performance of [     ]-02 appears to provide celebrants with substantial protection against radiation poisoning, and results in complete closure of the outer sheath., Attempts to view the area within the sheath, except by celebrants during performances of [     ]-02, have been unsuccessful.

In a 2003 interview, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 claimed that the original source code for [     ] consisted of approximately 12000 lines of ANSI/ISO C. This claim has not been verified., On startup, [     ] begins generating new versions of its source code in a separate thread of execution. [     ] does not modify itself in-memory. Instead, it keeps an internal copy of the source code which is modified iteratively. On a clean termination of [     ], the entire source code will be output to the working directory in a new directory named \"source\". In addition to modifications to the internal and external functionality of the program, alterations and additions to the semantics and structure of the language are made with each iteration. Due to its continuously-changing nature, the language has been nicknamed \"Morphic\"., When passed a list of source files, [     ] acts as a compiler and linker. Morphic code is always compilable by the version of [     ] by which it is output. However, older versions of the program can rarely compile code output by newer versions. On compilation, the program is output to an executable file named \"megaprime\"., Recent versions of the [     ] source code consist of approximately 70 million lines of heavily obfuscated Morphic., [     ] builds are archived on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588; the latest build is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

        "text": " [     ] is a set of tableware and dishes, consisting of 19 plates of various sizes and designs, and 21 goblets, champagne flutes, and other wineglasses. Several are ornately gilded, studded with diamonds and rubies, or made out of fine materials such as porcelain, china, and crystal. Most are extremely heavy, because of the weight of the rich metals. The cutlery, cloth, chairs, table, and other items that made up the banquet where [     ] was discovered have no anomalous properties, and are not contained., Whenever an edible solid is placed onto one of the plates or a liquid is poured into one of the drink vessels, the food will transform into human flesh, or the nearest equivalent organ, body part, or fluid. The change from one product to another seems to be based on similarities between color, smell, and composition, although vague symbolism and mental associations seem to be occasionally involved as well. For example, fleshy steaks will turn into cuts from the thigh, and red wine or juices into human blood. This can vary between subjects, and the process as to how a change is determined is still under investigation., Because most of the plates are not large enough in diameter and circumference to create the entire form, most pieces manifest as human infant parts; chicken wings as tiny burnt infant arms, chicken breasts as filleted infant pectoral muscle or tissue from the buttocks, and so forth. However, tissues from adults do appear occasionally, often when the meat is placed vertically, sticking into the air. Based on analysis on the captured videos and logs, this is how longer, more mature parts were designed, although the plate's products seem only to be able to project beyond the surface straight up at a limit of one meter (around 3 feet)., Vegetable and non animal matter can be affected, however this is often \u201cselective\u201d, and will only affect the \u201cmain dish\u201d. This means prepared meat will retain the herbs, spices, topping, sauces, and garnishes as it is transformed into human flesh. More than one piece of meat can be placed on [     ], but the results are varied; either creating separate pieces, incorporating them all together into one body system based on similarities in appearance (eggs and thin slices of beef turning into a female reproductive system, a pile of pig intestines and a cow stomach melding together to form a human digestive system), or choosing one to \u201cfocus\u201d on, and leaving all the others untouched (duck stuffed with Kobe beef becoming an infant torso stuffed with Kobe beef)., The other unique ability that [     ] possesses is any living creature placed on its surface or submerged inside liquid contained within a goblet will metamorphose into a moving human body part. It will be capable of kinetic activity, such as flexing, as in the case of a starfish that turned into a six-fingered baby's hand that opened and closed, and grasped at touch, or locomotion, no matter how awkward and slow it is. Severed areas do not bleed, and tendons and muscles still function in normal ways, regardless of damage., Tissues will move by whatever means is available, such as inching and crawling forward by curling and extending their \"body\", as the moving finger with an extremely long nail generated from a lobster did, or the floating penis in a large goblet did to \"swim\"; its tip jerking up and down to allow it to propel forward. If no form of locomotion is possible, the flesh will simply squirm and jiggle, remaining slightly warm to the touch. A pulse can be detected, even when the object in question is not attached to a heart., Transformed items will continue existing as human tissue until consumed, removed from the plate for a long period of time, or expiring from shock and pain, as many seem to freeze and go into a catatonic state similar to shock when stabbed or bitten into, in the case of \u201cliving\u201d tissues. Testing of stomach contents shows that transformed items remain \u201chuman\u201d if consumed., Acquisition: [     ] was acquired by Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. operatives on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588.

The wafers were described to have a \"light spongy taste\" and both manifestations caused \u201cextreme religious ecstasy\u201d when eaten and hallucinations of the smiling Christian God lovingly offering his body, quoting relative scripture pertaining to the event, and speaking intimately of their sins and tribulations. It is believed that this experience is based on the individuals, as testing with identical properties has not reproduced this effect., Addendum 01: See Supporting Document [     ]-XCH, Extract from Document [     ]-XCH Page 9, Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. employed [     ] at some of their more exotic auctions, performances, functions and dinners, during the meal portion.

The taste and novelty of the flesh was so popular that it was declared an \"exhibit\" by the Directors of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., and installed in a subsidiary restaurant, in the \u201cMembers Only\u201d section.

However, rather than being a network of sensors and computing systems, [     ] is an autonomous, self-aware entity of varying observable existence with direct access to all Russian nuclear sites and the ability to commence the launch of ICBMs stored therein., [     ] consists of the embalmed remains of Sergeant Marat Chernikov, a Russian soldier killed during the Soviet-Afghan War in 1982. While Sgt. Chernikov is referenced in Project December documentation, no official Russian Federation records exist regarding him at this time. [     ] serves as the locus for [     ]-01., In its dormant state, [     ]-01 is a semi-sentient consciousness capable of receiving and processing broadcast signals. [     ]-01 can apparently discern the informational content of any broadcast it receives. During times of what it perceives to be heightened global military tensions, especially those involving the Russian Federation and the former satellite states of the Soviet Union, [     ]-01 will begin to manifest, and becomes able to interact with the physical world to varying degrees. Manifestations have ranged from a barely perceptible, hazy human-shaped outline (believed to be related to an unintercepted report regarding the 2004 Russian Presidential election), to a glowing, bright-red apparition in the distended shape of a child missing its legs (Containment Breach 1984-13, 08/07/2008)., When [     ]-01 manifests in this manner, its secondary abilities become apparent. These include the ability to directly interface with nuclear command systems within an approximately 50\u00a0m radius, and combat capabilities focused on severe disruption of the human nervous system. When [     ] fully manifests, it can move at speeds measured up to 140\u00a0km/h, and will immediately attempt to travel to the nearest functioning land-based strategic rocket installation housing R-36M ICBMs (the nearest installation is currently \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588, 81\u00a0km NW of Armed Containment Complex-04), access its command system, and launch all missiles at their present targets. It will repeat this process until it has launched all remaining missiles under Russian control., [     ]-01 is extremely hostile to any human it perceives as interfering with it, and will engage any personnel in its immediate path. [     ]-01 has shown limited vulnerability to microwave radiation; however, this serves to misdirect and \"confuse\" the entity rather than directly harm it., "

        "text": " [     ] is believed to be an irregularly-shaped asteroid orbiting Earth at a distance of approximately 180 kilometers. [     ] is approximately 8km in diameter at its widest point, and has an unusually high density of 670\u00a0g/cm3. [     ] is believed to have been captured by Earth's gravity approximately 3.2 billion years ago. [     ] is in a retrograde orbit around the Earth, traveling at a rate of approximately 90 minutes per each orbit. Although only 1/437th of the diameter of the moon, [     ] appears much larger in comparison due to the shorter distance between it and Earth. Depending on the angle of solar light relative to [     ], it goes through several phases (waxing, full, waning, new) similar to the Earth's moon., [     ] is subject to a memetic phenomenon where it is incapable of being observed by human beings by sentient individuals unless an individual announces the presence of [     ] either verbally or legibly, and indicates it in some way, such as circling it in a photograph or pointing out its location with a hand gesture. The exact area indicated is inconsequential; [     ] can be viewed at several different locations in the sky by several different individuals, even in daylight conditions. The existence of [     ] is dubious; measurements of the space that [     ] theoretically should occupy show only empty space. However, these same measurements, when performed by a person aware of [     ], seemingly show the existence of the object. For the purposes of this document, it is assumed that [     ] does indeed exist., Those who are aware of the existence of [     ] will perceive several differences in the environment around them. For example, once an individual is aware of [     ], they will be able to perceive light reflected off of it by the sun, increasing their night vision during times when [     ] is visible. The most prominent effect, however, concerns tidal cycles and [     ]'s effect on them. [     ] exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth similar to, but weaker than, the moon's; however, this pull, combined with the moon's natural attraction, causes more severe tidal cycles, leading to those affected by [     ] perceiving that sea levels are approximately \u2588\u2588 meters lower than the norm at low tide, and up to \u2588\u2588\u2588 meters at high tide, and that approximately 85% of coastlines and most islands around the world have been flooded. Persons entering affected areas by any means (excluding air travel) move as if though affected by an unseen liquid, usually starting about \u2588 kilometers inland of the actual start of the water line. Subjects are incapable of swimming through this liquid, and have great difficulty moving, indicating that the liquid has a higher viscosity than water. At the point where individuals affected by [     ] have the liquid going above their head, they begin suffocating and undergo severe hypoxia, essentially drowning on dry land. This can be prevented through use of breathing apparatuses such as scuba tanks. Also, volcanic activity is perceived to increase, with minor eruptions from several volcanic sites occurring frequently, and rarely results in death due to volcanic activity (i.e. violent eruptions causing ash plumes, exposure to lava causing combustion)., Addendum: Discovery of [     ]: Original containment of [     ] was established 2 months after its original discovery by Alexander Montag, an amateur astronomer studying at State University of New York Maritime College, Bronx, New York. Shortly after his discovery, Montag barricaded himself on the roof of the college and refused to leave for any reason, making notes on [     ] (which he had dubbed \"Luna 2\") and its effects on the tidal cycle, believing the rest of New York City to have drowned under a massive tidal surge and that all individuals he encountered were simply hallucinations. Montag eventually constructed a boat made from an air conditioning unit and attempted to push it off into what he describes as the \"New York Sea\", resulting in him falling from the roof of the college and subsequently dying. The Foundation began investigating the incident when it was found Mr. Montag had survived the fall, and had died from suffocation and hypoxia. Agents recovered Mr. Montag's journal, which contained all information currently known about [     ], and serves as the primary vector for the meme. It is currently unknown how Mr. Montag discovered [     ] without any prior information regarding it., "

The main difference is the hermit-crab-like behavior of attaching grains of sand to its back. It is unknown what purpose the sand serves, but the massive colony of [     ] numbers in the hundreds of billions to possibly trillions, creating a rather large dune., The similarities between [DATA EXPUNGED] and [     ] are only superficial. [DATA EXPUNGED]'s colony is protozoan in nature and apparently shows a collective intelligence and awareness that is not understood. [     ]'s colony is made up of individual Acari who don't show cooperation but rather competition in the hunt for food. Like mosquitoes, they rely on chemical detection of carbon dioxide and sugars in the air to detect prey. The Acari mites roll and bound over one another toward prey, only using their legs to climb over one another. When in contact with the flesh of animals, they release a numbing chemical toxin in their bite, similar in make-up to that of mosquito and flea bite toxins. Subjects are typically unaware that millions of mites are 'taking turns' at grabbing mouthfuls of its flesh as they swarm around their victim., A typical swarm resembles a swirling vortex around a victim or victim's appendage. The [     ] colony is efficient enough in their competitive swarming that most animals' appendages can be de-fleshed and reduced to bone within minutes. The numbing toxin is so effective that sleeping victims may not wake up as their limbs are eaten away., The Acari mites are resistant to all but the most dangerous of pesticides. They retreat from heat and will often seek shade when available, being the most active during the night, hunting for large sleeping prey.

The effect is exponential in that, upon each playback, the number of subjects in each videos doubles.

None of these entities appear to have knowledge of [     ]'s effect, and find it highly distressing., Although affecting linked videos, [     ] effect is unique to each viewer; that is, [     ]'s effect is dependent on how many times the individual person has watched the video. If more than one subject is viewing it, this effect will occur based on who physically initiated playback. If the subject views a series of related videos the effect will carry over in these subsequent viewings., [     ] primarily affects videos taking place in enclosed environments, although this is not universal and cannot be confirmed as a deliberate effect. Once affected by [     ], it is not possible for recorded subjects to exit the area in which the video is taking place. At a certain point, these subjects will suffer traumatic injuries leading to death due to the exponential humanoids instantaneously appearing at the beginning of video playback. This does not prevent [     ]'s effect from persisting., Eventually, playback reaches a point where the camera and sound equipment are destroyed due to intense viscera pressure in the enclosed space. This can also occur in outdoor videos, although taking more playbacks to reach that point.

High-speed photography of [     ]-1 manifestation through windowed or glass doors has revealed the effect to be as near to instantaneous as can be measured. As such, the mechanism for this transformation is unknown. The space originally present behind this door remains accessible when approached from other entrances or via the destruction of walls; however, the door in use by [     ] remains indestructible and cannot be opened from within by any means while [     ] remains active., [     ]-1 appears to be Office CB-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, located on the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 floor of Site-17\u2019s Euclid objects experimentation wing1.

What effect, if any, the two manifestations have on one another has yet to be determined. GPS tracking and [REDACTED] indicate that while all instances occupy the same physical location, they are separated by an unknown interval of time.

The accidental exposure of Agent B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and subsequent testing with D-Class personnel has revealed that anomalous properties are isolated to the reverse side and require the reading and comprehension in total for anomalous properties to manifest.

Additionally, it has proven capable of running at speeds of up to 80\u00a0km/h (50 mph) in short bursts and leaping approximately 5 metres from a running start. Due to the extreme temperatures produced by 060-Alpha during the initial stages of manifestation, along with its physical capabilities, it is capable of causing large, uncontrolled fires and widespread property damage if left unchecked. [     ]-Alpha appears to intentionally avoid burning instances of [     ] when it becomes active., If [     ]-Alpha is introduced to a high enough volume of water or other flame-retardant material over a short amount of time, it will begin to weaken to the point that it will collapse into dust.

        "text": " [     ] is a perceptual anomaly affecting individuals who have consumed pressure-cooked fried chicken seasoned with Kentucky Fried Chicken's proprietary \"Eleven Secret Herbs and Spices\". For a period of time after consumption, people affected by the anomaly will perceive depictions of Jesus Christ as being altered to resemble American businessman and restauranteur Colonel Harland David Sanders, clad in his trademark white suit and bolo tie. Altered depictions will be of similar art style to the original. All manner of visual depictions are affected, including secular depictions., The perceived degree of resemblance between depictions of Christ and Colonel Sanders diminishes with time, fading completely after one to two hours following consumption of a typical three-piece chicken meal. Consuming larger quantities of chicken results in this effect persisting for longer. An upper limit to this effect has been reported at approximately 72 hours following consumption of an entire 20-piece chicken bucket in one sitting., Based on analysis of Kentucky Fried Chicken sales and church attendance in the United States, it is estimated that at least 150,000 North Americans have at one time been affected by [     ] since the first reported case of the anomaly in January 1974. Reports of manifestations outside of the North American continent have been sparse, likely due to substitution of the highly-perishable and locally-sourced \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-variety peppercorns used in the seasoning recipe in foreign markets. The majority of [     ] cases are believed to remain unreported due to the temporary nature of the effect and the natural human tendency to preserve normality and maintain a consensus reality., History: Prior to identification of its source, knowledge of [     ] was suppressed through localised distribution of amnestics whenever encountered by field agents; this was sufficient to catalyse self-suppression among affected members of the populace. Extensive testing conducted by Site-88 researchers determined the factors for its cause in 1974. Full-scale containment of [     ] was soon enacted, culminating in the infiltration of Kentucky Fried Chicken's Louisville headquarters by a joint Foundation-UIU task force in April 1975. Embedded agents were successful in accessing the locked safe containing the anomalous recipe, and replacing it with a gustatorily similar substitute. Contracts with Griffith Laboratories and McCormick &amp; Company were also altered accordingly by covert agents, allowing the replacement recipe to propagate throughout the North American supply chain in a matter of months. Total containment of [     ] is believed to have been completed by October of the same year., In December 1975, following his public statements on the altered quality of Kentucky Fried Chicken's recipes (refer to Document-3250-H-066), Sanders was designated as POI-3250 and placed under covert observation. A settlement was privately reached with Sanders in 1976 through Foundation contacts in Heublein Inc., then-parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken, offering a payout of $1 million USD as compensation. Regardless, Sanders continued to publically denigrate the quality of Kentucky Fried Chicken's culinary standards, and maintained the assertion that his original recipes had been altered by Heublein Inc. until his death in 1980., Investigation into Sanders and his association with esoteric clandestine organisations continued until his death in 1980, finding nothing unusual in both his history and former ties. It was concluded that Sanders was neither aware of nor responsible for the [     ] phenomenon., Addendum: List of notable [     ] manifestations requiring Foundation suppression, "

The other end of [     ] extends straight upward many kilometers up into the sky to a yet-to-be-explored satellite in geostationary orbit above the Earth at an altitude of about 39\u00a0km (over 22 miles away, known as \"the Summit\" amongst researchers)., Several times a year, a monk of the temple ascends up the rope several hundred meters in a ritual of spiritual enlightenment. The monks report that to this day, only one person by the name of [DATA EXPUNGED] has ever been killed during the ascension. Throughout the centuries, several climbers have disappeared, yet the monks believe that one day they will return, bringing greater understanding and enlightenment with them., Carbon dating of rope fibers put [     ] at just over 1400 years old. Foundation anthropologists believe that the rope and the tradition of climbing it began within the rituals of an ancient, dead religion before Emperor Songts\u00e4n Gampo brought Buddhism to Tibet. At that time, it is believed that the rope was several kilometers longer. The attendant monks say that the jade ring was added in the early 9th century by the Ralpacan to keep seasonal winds from picking up the rope and swinging it throughout the country side. Several times a year, the head monks untie the rope from the loop of jade and reposition the knot. Research has shown that in recent years, the rope has moved skyward at a rate of about 180\u00a0cm per year and is slightly accelerating at a rate of a hundredth of a centimeter/year\u00b2. With only a few hundred meters of rope left, the monks are unsure of what do to when it reaches the end. Some hope to add length by attaching separate sections of rope to the original, while others believe that new rope won't have the strength of the old., Research has been unable to explain how plant fiber rope has been able to survive 1400 years and maintain such tensile strength at such extreme temperatures and conditions of the upper atmosphere and space that people are able to climb it, let alone support its own enormous weight against itself (all 39\u00a0km worth of rope). If the Summit is accelerating away from earth, its pull on [     ] is also unexplained., The Summit has only been properly imaged by ground-based telescopes, which show the rope of [     ] going up and over the edge of a large asteroid-like rock, several hundred meters in width. Satellites have been unable to picture the opposite (\"Dark\") side of the Summit. It has been reasoned that orbiting satellites are designed to image ground-based locations or distant space objects at much greater distances than other neighboring orbital satellites.

During the dream, the player\u2019s perceptions are indistinguishable from reality. Extreme cases will show physical manifestations of injuries suffered within the dream. Examples include one subject who presented with bleeding of the fingernails after dreaming of unsuccessful attempts to escape the trunk of a car driven into the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 River, another subject who developed severe bruising of the face and strain of the anterior longitudinal ligament after dreaming of being beaten by a hostile police officer, and another subject who presented with partial paralysis after dreaming being a victim of a 1929 gangland execution in a Chicago garage., Typically, such injuries are transient even in cases where the dreams end in fatality. However, severe psychological after-effects are likely, and will tend to be more severe than if the dreamed trauma had actually happened during a waking state. This is in large part due to the lack of volition subjects experience in the dream, and the foreknowledge of what is about to happen to them. All subjects report a complete belief in the reality of the dream world, even knowing they are replaying events from the game. If a subject has died violently in the game, the subsequent dream of the event can be traumatic enough that this belief can foster a delusion that the real world is unreal. Victims of this delusion report being convinced that they are still dreaming, or are in purgatory. Both physiological and psychological reactions are not clinically abnormal for the stresses subjects report experiencing within these dreams., Given the experimental evidence of in-game actions having actual historical impact (ref: Experiment Log 687-A) it is theorized that the dreaming state is a side effect caused by the player\u2019s perceptions of game-directed activity catching up to the present day., Addendum 1: Experiment Log for [     ], "

The unusual properties of [     ] were apparent upon discovering that the power cord extended an indefinite length into the soil directly below [     ], despite which a steady voice was speaking through the earphone. Investigations regarding how long the cord is have since been officially discontinued (see Addendum 270-A)., What makes [     ] of continued interest is the audio stream from the earphone, which has since been discovered to contain encrypted messages that are of value to the Foundation. Said ciphers are referred to as [     ]-1., For the most part, [     ]-1 consists of a mildly distorted human female voice (see Addendum 270-B) speaking in a steady monotone, which has been recorded listing names, cryptic phrases, patterns of numbers, quotes, mangled quotes, strings of letters, [DATA EXPUNGED] incomprehensible words, sounds that cannot be produced by any known animal that continue for extended amounts of time (\u2588\u2588\u2588 unconfirmed languages have been distinguished to date, \u2588\u2588 of which are reoccurring), monologues, nursery rhymes, [REDACTED] leading to speculation as to whether or not the narrator is in fact human, etc., The following have also been recorded: melodies, periods of silence (see Addendum 270-C), metallic scraping noises, metallic scraping noises that have been looped and re-calibrated so they play roughly in the same tune as several classical music tunes and a handful of [DATA EXPUNGED], Morse code, [REDACTED] human screaming, various computer programming languages, every known language on earth (including, in one incident, Pig Latin), [DATA EXPUNGED] possibly of biological origin, condescending laughter, music, music played backwards, music [REDACTED], conversations that have evidently been recorded ranging from [REDACTED] politically significant and extensively protected area to what was most likely an average household, discussing what grocery supplies to buy from the supermarket, static, ambient soundtracks, etc., A demonstrative sample of [     ]-1 can be found here., [     ] is otherwise a perfectly normal phone and is susceptible to damage as similar phones would be. Disassembly has not uncovered the source of [     ]\u2019s unusual properties., Speaking into [     ] has no effect on [     ]-1. Currently disputed, refer to Incident-270-\u2588 in which [DATA EXPUNGED]., Attempts to decipher [     ]-1 have yielded partial successes. In one notable case, a complicated cipher proved to be an intensive description of an SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s imminent attempt to breach containment. Evidence of such was found in the [REDACTED] of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s containment. Containment breach was accordingly prevented. Decoded portions have alternately been startlingly useful to the Foundation, and immensely frustrating to both personnel working on [     ]-1 and Foundation officials. For example, one \u2588\u2588-hour study of what seemed to be a significant cipher proved to translate into a long and painstakingly thorough list of extremely unofficial synonyms for a human \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588., Likewise, information gained from [     ]-1 have both [DATA EXPUNGED] preventing a possible XK-class end-of-the-world scenario, and listed \u2018secret ingredients\u2019 of Dr. R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s widely praised cherry pie. As it is impossible to determine how useful portions of [     ]-1 will be, personnel are advised to choose whatever segments of [     ]-1 they deem to be most promising. However, some portions of cipher are either too intricately encrypted for our most perspicacious personnel to decode, or indeed may hold no meaning at all., Attempts to decode [     ]-1 are continually ongoing (see Addenda 270-D and 270-E)., Addendum 270-A: A probe was extended a total of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 meters along the wire before the maximum extension length was reached. The matter has since been declared not of sufficient interest to merit a more thorough examination., Addendum 270-B: As of \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 military time, the unidentified female voice of [     ]-1 stuttered for \u2588 seconds before breaking down into what researchers described as \u2018disconsolate sobs,\u2019 pleading to be [REDACTED]. This continued for \u2588\u2588 seconds before audio cut off abruptly to a \u2588\u2588-minute excerpt of [     ]-1 from \u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588. Immediately afterwards, [     ]-1 proceeded as usual, the only noticeable difference being that the voice narrating [     ]-1 was male., Addendum 270-C: Further examinations revealed that this was in fact not silence, but audio stimuli both too high or too low pitched for human perception. \u2588\u2588\u2588 additional unidentified languages have been discovered upon supplying Outpost Delta with appropriate audio equipment., Addendum 270-D: As of late, [     ]-1 has been becoming noticeably more difficult to decode. This includes utilizing more convoluted methods of encryption, loud background noises being added while the narrator is speaking, multiple voices speaking at once, and, in one case, loud [REDACTED] extremely personal details [REDACTED] Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who was visibly shaken by the event. Morale has since plummeted while stress levels have skyrocketed., A computer program has been coded in order to automatically decode portions of [     ]-1.

Individuals affected by [     ] demonstrate knowledge not only of the existence of this organization, but which specific sub-unit they belong to, and a detailed sense of their duties to be carried out as part of [     ]. Interviews with affected subjects suggest that this knowledge is spontaneously obtained through unknown means, usually between the ages of 17-32.

Though originally recovered in an inactive state, the artifact presently produces a directional electromagnetic pulse every 7ns. Disrupting or jamming the pulse reduces, but does not eliminate, the artifact's primary effects. The device's electromagnetic effects are therefore theorized to be a carrier wave for, or side-effect of, the device's primary function., Targets are selected randomly from the 20,736 (12^4) nearest human subjects, ignoring those already exhibiting the effects of the pulse, but including those who are immune. The device appears to have no effective maximum range: on several occasions, the device has exhibited the ability to make over-the-horizon broadcasts to otherwise occluded subjects by deflecting its signal off of the Earth's ionosphere. The artifact's means of detecting human consciousness, and the causative mechanism underlying its effects, are presently unknown., Upon receipt of the signal, subjects permanently experience increased suggestibility, severe abulia, and short-term memory loss. These effects are secondary to the artifact's primary effect, which is substantial reduction in prefrontal SQ2 signal. Due to information recovered from SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, Foundation researchers presently believe that this reduced SQ2 signal corresponds to a significant reduction in, or total destruction of, the subject's subjective consciousness. Moderate authoritarian-submissive personality traits appear to provide conditional immunity to the effects of the broadcast; accordingly, since its activation, containment protocols have required placement in high-population-density areas subject to a totalitarian government., [     ] was originally recovered from a Cistercian monastery in southeastern Algeria by Italian special forces in January of 1938. Laboratory notes from that period mention a rhodium carbide outer casing, embossed with lettering in a known but poorly-characterized Semitic alphabet. That outer casing is presumed to have been destroyed or lost by Italian researchers before the object's transfer to Leipzig in 1944. Between 1938 and 1944, the governments of Germany and Italy attempted to activate the artifact, both without success. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the object was kept in East German custody. The East German government took no recorded action with respect to the artifact., In 1947, the East German government transferred [     ] to Soviet control, who moved it to Kyshtim, Chelyabinsk Oblast, USSR. In September of 1957, Soviet researchers intentionally activated [     ]. Though the artifact affected human targets in its immediate surroundings, then-existing features of the Soviet government prevented the EK-class end of human consciousness. After attempted nuclear sterilization of the affected area, the Soviet government contacted the Foundation through intergovernmental liaisons, and the artifact was transferred to Foundation custody at Site 67, southwest of Chernhiv, Ukraine. Since initial containment, the artifact has only been transferred once: in 1986, due to predicted instability in the Soviet government, the artifact was transferred to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea., Shortly thereafter, the Foundation commenced construction of the Ryugyong Containment Facility, where the object has been stored since its completion in 1988., "

        "text": " [     ] is a rapidly developing ecosystem enclosed by a temporal anomaly, located in a chamber, \u2588\u2588\u2588 km in diameter. The chamber is located at [DATA REDACTED], approximately \u2588 km below the surface, initially believed to have been a natural nuclear fission reactor due to relatively high amounts of emitted radiation. It is currently unknown how the chamber is able to remain stable despite its size, or why the chamber is cooler than the surrounding mantle, however it is hypothesized that this is related to the temporal anomaly in some way., Initial observations of [     ] noted unusually high levels of incredibly energetic ionizing radiation, with both wavelength and flux decreasing as one travels away from the centre of the chamber. When researchers looked into the centre of [     ], they observed it as appearing incredibly hazy and distorted. It was soon discovered that both of these observations were related to the above mentioned time anomaly. As one approaches the centre of the chamber, time is observed to pass at a different rate, such that an observer farther from the centre sees external time pass more quickly than an observer closer in., The relationship between time and the distance from centre is such that radiation that enters the anomaly is red-shifted so that, when it is reflected from an object within, it is scattered in a manner consistent with a much lower frequency wave. Likewise, radiation produced in the centre of the anomaly, no matter how low its energy, is blue-shifted to such an extent that the end result, when observed from outside, appears as high energy ionizing radiation. Though the actual source is unknown, calculations indicate that, at the centre, the photons are consistent with the primary resonance frequency of electromagnetic radiation in the chamber itself (approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588 Hz, at a rate of [REDACTED]). Despite the rate of photon production being very low, the compression of time ultimately results in lethal doses of ionizing radiation at certain distances., The innermost Green Zone (initially labeled the Black Zone) is a region in which flux and frequency of radiation are such that life can theoretically be sustained. The Red Zone is where the radiation is blue-shifted to potentially dangerous frequencies and the flux is high enough that lethal exposure is guaranteed. Radiation in the outermost White Zone, though more energetic, is sufficiently diffused that radiation poisoning can be treated, so long as exposure is limited., When initially discovered, the entirety of [     ] was sterile, due to the effects of ionizing radiation, as verified by Expeditions E-1859-1 and E-1859-2. Samples from within the Black Zone confirmed a thick deposit of simple organic matter. Following Expedition E-1859-3, from which D-2388 did not return, a sudden decrease in oxygen levels within the chamber was observed before levels restabilized. E-1859-6 through E-1859-8 found a coating of slime on the chamber floor which increased in mass as time went on. This slime, along with other life seen in future observations, have been determined to have descended from the gut flora of D-2388, based on recovered samples., Drops in radiation flux were noted after E-1859-8, determined, in later expeditions, to be related to the emergence of photosynthetic organisms which use the resonant radiation of the chamber as an energy source. In addition, primitive animal-like life forms had been observed., On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, observations from Monitoring Station \u2588\u2588 saw signs of fauna native to the Green Zone performing actions inside the White Zone. Despite the majority not surviving long after passing through the Red Zone, excursions of native fauna have since increased in frequency, leading to current Special Containment Procedures., Addendum 1859-1: Expedition E-1859-\u2588\u2588 has found evidence of primitive tools used within the Green Zone. The life form that produced the tool has not yet been directly encountered, however this suggests the potential of a sapient entity developing within this ecosystem. New expeditions have been scheduled over the following days to search for further signs of an emerging civilization., Addendum 1859-2: Expeditions E-1859-\u2588\u2588 through \u2588\u2588 have shown little change in the design of new-found tools, suggesting that the population producing these tools are remaining stagnant in their development. The search for the creatures that made them is ongoing., "

        "text": " [     ] is a gravitational anomaly in elliptical orbit around the Earth. It has an orbital period of 4 hours, with a furthest distance from the surface of the Earth of 12,430\u00a0km and a closest approach of 395\u00a0km. Measurement of the gravitational anomaly indicates it has a mass of 1.24 x 1013 kg. At the location of the anomaly, there is an apparent object of approximately 50m x 30m x 15m. This gives the object a measured density of 5.51 x 108 kg/m3, which is approximately 100,000 times the density of the Earth and close to the density of a white dwarf star., The shape of this object is variable in appearance, with components of different materials appearing to erupt from the surface of the object only to be reabsorbed. Furthermore, the object is virtually invisible to electromagnetic radiation and has no measurable charge, magnetic moment, or wave emissions. However, despite this behavior, photons in the visible light spectrum still interact with the object, albeit at a low albedo of 0.01., The anomaly behaves very differently on the quantum level. [     ] is comprised of bosonic matter that anomalously maintains much of the structure of fermionic (normal) matter. This anomalous construction causes the Pauli Exclusion Principle not to apply, allowing matter to occupy the same quantum state as other similarly composed bosonic matter. In addition, electromagnetic interaction is suppressed. As a result, the bosonic electron fields between objects in [     ] do not repel each other., The net result of these anomalous quantum effects is that multiple individual objects within [     ] occupy the same place at the same time. What appears to be objects growing out of and receding into [     ] is actually thousands of colocating objects oscillating about the gravitational center of the anomaly. The exceptionally high mass of [     ] is the result of these thousands of individual objects occupying the same location, all gravitationally bound together., It is important to note that this colocation is not a spatiotemporal distortion, but the net result of the lack of interaction between individual objects in the anomaly. There is no risk of a \"reversion\" to a Euclidean space, because the space is already Euclidean., The influence of the gravitation of thousands of objects acts as a strange attractor, keeping each individual object within 105\u00a0m of the center of [     ] at all times. The chaotic nature of the attractor has caused multiple objects to be shown at the surface of [     ] at different intervals. Most of the items expressed are space dust and rocky debris similar in composition to asteroids. The following items are notable, however:, Addendum 2460-A: On 2/15/2013, a stray orbiting steel bolt attached to a retaining plate from the [REDACTED] disaster was seen to be captured by the gravity well and collide with [     ]. It was observed that the collision caused no impact site and the bolt passed through the matter without hindrance. However, post collision the bolt and plate no longer registered any electromagnetic field deformation. Further observation demonstrated that the bolt remains attached to the plate, confirming that the colocation effect of items caught within the anomaly does not extend to items that are exposed within milliseconds to it., This observation further suggests that all objects seen in [     ] were, at one time, normal fermionic matter, transformed by the anomaly into the presently seen amalgamation. It is hypothesized that the anomaly annihilates the quantum spin of the subatomic particles, transforming the matter from fermionic to bosonic and allowing it to colocate. Containment procedures updated to prevent further matter collisions with [     ]. Further testing is suggested., Addendum 2460-B: On 2/5/2014, [     ] was noted to pass within 70\u00a0km of Foundation Orbital Unit-11, and a sortie was authorized to intercept the anomaly for quantum measurements. Agent Rick Roberts was sent in Probe OU11-3 to examine the anomaly at close range for testing of the quantum signature of the matter within the object. Radio contact with Probe OU11-3 ceased when the probe came within 5\u00a0km of the central mass. Approximately 0.5 seconds before loss of contact, apparent density of the low Earth orbit medium seen to increase from 1.0 x 10-11 kg/m3 to 7.3 x 10-9 kg/m3., All remaining data from the experiment comes from the cameras aboard Orbital Unit-11. Agent Roberts quickly noted the lack of radio contact, and engaged thrusters to maneuver away from [     ]. The fuel was seen to ignite and pass ineffectually through the hull and cabin of Probe OU11-3. Unable to adjust position or trajectory, Probe OU11-3 was gravitationally captured by [     ] and fell into the central mass., 15,534\u00a0kg added to the mass of [     ]. Trajectory and Schwarzschild radius recalculated. Containment procedures updated to include a mandatory distance of 50\u00a0km., "

The exterior of the cabinet is painted matte green and bears no remarkable features except small areas of corrosion and light scratching commensurate with being left exposed to the elements for a prolonged period of time. The doors of the cabinet are fitted with a basic slide-bolt and a hasp for a padlock, allowing the door to be secured from outside., The interior dimensions of [     ] display significant disparity with the exterior; the doors open into an apparently extradimensional space containing a large labyrinth complex comprised of an as-yet uncharted series of corridors. The walls, floor and ceiling of the corridors are constructed from heavily-rusted steel and adhere to the same height and width scales as the exterior of [     ] (2\u00a0m high by 1.2\u00a0m wide)., The corridors within [     ] are lit at irregular intervals by what appear to be regular household lightbulbs, secured to the walls in wire mesh fittings. Many of the bulbs are observed to flicker and numerous others are burned out or broken. In places several large-gauge steel pipes have been found bolted to the walls of the tunnels; these pipes are notably cold to the touch and contain flowing water, although the source and destination of the pipes and water are unknown. Many of the pipes observed are in obvious need of repair and leak cold (average of 3\u00b0C) water.

High-speed cameras have revealed that this process, which lasts less than 0.3 seconds, involves the manifestation of lips, gingiva, and disproportionately large incisor teeth; the lips cauterize the injury via an unknown mechanism, after which the lips, gingiva, and teeth de-manifest.

All were found to be attired in armor that, while roughly Mycenaean in design, is composed of material never used in ancient warfare - a lead and copper alloy with an inner lining composed of asbestos fabric. The helmet would have completely covered the head with a green, tinted glass visor over the face. Tubes, constructed from goat intestines, fed outside air directly into the mouths of the pilots.

It is believed that these objects functioned as projectiles, employed by an unidentified anomalous organism. Indentations around the torso are suggestive of constriction by a large, flexible and prehensile appendage. Originally thought to be caused by natural corrosion, [     ]'s outer layer was damaged by a strong acidic substance likely associated with the previously noted unidentified anomalous organism., Physical evidence suggests that the reactor core melted through the posterior torso, penetrating the earth and continues to burn at more than 1200\u00a0\u00b0C.

Though it apparently lacks a reservoir, the nib never appears to run out of fresh ink. In addition, the pen writes in Iron Gall ink, which is suitable for artists but would normally corrode typical fountain pens quickly., Research has surmised that any subject holding [     ] loses all autonomy of the hand and arm that grasps it. Full sensation is intact, but the arm below the elbow is controlled by unknown forces, theoretically centralized within [     ]. One effect is that the \"controlled\" hand will start to use the pen to write a detailed biography of the individual holding the pen. The biography will include such information as the person's name, age, date of birth, criminal record, fears, etc. Other times the pen has been known to write such things as an occurrence that happened in the person's lifetime. For example, when Test Subject 1204M held [     ], he began to write a detailed record of a motor vehicle accident he had been in the year before. Later, the subject admitted that many details penned in the account were not readily available to him at present time (i.e. the subject had forgotten many elements present in the written work, including his previous car's license plate number, the other vehicle's color, and so on). The subject stated that his memory of the event was so fresh in his mind during the transcription that he \"could taste the blood in his mouth.\", Quoted Response-01: \"I don't really know how to explain it, it just kind of happened. When I picked up the pen, it seemed as if my hand wasn't my own anymore. I knew I could move it if I wanted to, but I chose not to because I loved the picture I was drawing. It was like my hand had life. Suddenly, my hand stopped and I realized I had complete control over my hand again, and I put the pen back down. I looked at the drawing and saw how beautiful it was. I guess the pen decided it was done, and was finished with me.\", "

When first acquired by field operatives, [     ] was in badly rusted condition, with heavy pitting from blood stains and other bodily fluids trapped in micro-crevices within the blade. Following thorough analysis, these irregularities were removed for aesthetic purposes. This has had negligible, if any, effect on [     ]'s special properties., The first recorded appearance of [     ] was in the 1960s, during the infamous [DATA EXPUNGED] case. [DATA EXPUNGED], a New York woman living alone, was allegedly raped and murdered by subject [DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite the fact that 38 witnesses reported hearing the attack, none of them attempted to aid the young woman for over six hours, until her eventual death. Whether the item received its properties due to this event, or whether it had them beforehand, is a matter of debate (see Dr. [REDACTED]'s paper re: the Bystander Effect, vs. Dr. [REDACTED]'s theory regarding psychic imprintation.), What is clear, however, is its current properties. When carried by a human or humanoid entity with violent intent towards another human or humanoid entity, [     ] broadcasts a psychic signal that renders all sentient beings with a Psionic Resistance Index of 97 or lower incapable of assisting the victim. Affected entities report a sudden sense of apathy while under [     ]'s influence: sensory input is not affected, and affected entities report feeling revulsion and horror, but are simply incapable of acting, even indirectly, to assist the victim. Meanwhile, it renders the victim incapable of defending themselves against their attacker., Tests using Class-D personnel have shown no upper limit in the number of entities affected by the psychic resonance. In one test, twelve Class D Personnel due for first-of-the-month termination were placed in a room alongside a researcher who was told to randomly select one test subject for death. The researcher killed all test subjects one by one, despite their professed horror. Prior incidents have indicated the possibility of hundreds, if not thousands of deaths due to [     ]'s unique properties (see Incident Report 668 A re: [REDACTED] Mall massacre and subsequent information blackout operations)., Recovery of [     ] in such scenarios is problematic due to the item's psychic properties. Agents attempting to apprehend the subject during Containment Failure Incidents are often themselves affected by [     ]'s so-called \"Apathy Field,\" resulting in casualties among Foundation personnel. Following Incident 668-A, standard retrieval protocol includes the use of a long-range sniper rifle, double-blind conditions, and three different agents working in tandem through carefully coordinated actions to prevent any of them realizing that they are actively opposing the subject., Because of the obvious apocalyptic possibilities, it is the recommendation of this panel that [     ] be designated a Keter-level threat and placed in high-level confinement., Addendum 668-a: Following further testing, it has been determined that test subjects wielding [     ] can be terminated through passive response, so long as the terminating agent is introduced before the subject takes possession of [     ].

No willful action by [     ]-2 will permanently rid them of the penny. Dropping, throwing or giving away the penny will result in the penny reappearing somewhere on [     ]-2\u2019s person within 4 seconds. Ownership transfer requires the death of [     ]-2 followed by another person picking the penny up, or the theft (non-consensual taking) of the penny from its current owner., Within two hours of the penny\u2019s acquisition, objects touched by most exposed body parts (See Test Log) of [     ]-2 are instantly transmuted into 1 or more 1974 pennies. For approximately the first 24 hours, the effect will only manifest on small objects, barely larger than a penny. Over the next 2 weeks, the effect will increase the maximum size of affected objects, probability of transmutation on contact, and percentage of matter converted on contact. Eventually, contact with [     ]-2 will convert all solid, contiguous matter into pennies., Objects that are smaller than a penny in any dimension are not affected. Transmutation only occurs as long as [     ]-2 is alive., The effect conserves volume rather than mass. That is, all space occupied by the converted object will be replaced as efficiently as possible by pennies, with any remaining non-transmuted volume apparently lost.

These forms always appear partially filled with the expected liquid a vessel of that type would contain., Currently, [     ] appears as an ordinary white, porcelain coffee mug with blue, vertical stripes evenly spaced around its exterior. There are no visible manufacturer markings or otherwise remarkable details about its appearance in its current form. The object has resisted all attempts at destruction or sampling for further analysis. When inactive, [     ] can hold the expected 240\u00a0mL (8 fl oz) of liquid that any standard coffee mug would hold., Anomalous behavior does not manifest until a live human being grasps [     ] to hold it. Approximately 2 - 5 seconds after the SCP is held, it will instantly bond itself through unknown, albeit painful means to the handler\u2019s hand or hands. Test subjects have reported the pain of bonding with [     ] as a \u201csearing\u201d or \u201cfiery\u201d sensation, though no heat can be detected by outside observers or instruments. The use of gloves or other barriers between the object and the hand does not prevent the bonding process so long as the subject can still grip [     ]. Extensive testing has revealed that the bond appears to be at the molecular level and is permanent until the death of its holder. To date, no means have been found to break the bond including cutting or severing the fingers or hand of the holder as any wounds below the wrist of the test subject heal instantaneously. Further proposed testing of the range of healing up the handler\u2019s arm is pending approval., Once bonded, any liquid inside [     ] will disappear and the container will inexplicably begin to fill from the bottom-up with a fluid or a semi-solid material, stopping only once it reaches the top of the container. The liquid or semi-solid is different for each holder, but it has to date been a bodily fluid or human excretion in each test instance. Such instances have included human saliva, sweat, blood, bile, mucus, urine, feces, and [DATA EXPUNGED] as well as combinations of two or more of these., Once [     ] has filled, the holder will undergo rapid dehydration and/or emaciation, becoming increasingly malnourished to the point of death, which usually occurs within 24 hours if nothing is done to prevent it. Ingestion of standard foods, liquids, or I.V.-supplied nutrients does nothing to reverse or slow this process. Testing has revealed that the only means by which the subject can gain nourishment is by consuming the contents of [     ]; however, the constant rate of dehydration and emaciation remains the same, forcing the test subject to consume vast quantities of the excretions almost constantly to remain alive. As the contents are consumed or \u2013 as is often the case \u2013 dumped out of the container, [     ] will continue to refill itself automatically. Test subjects have lasted as long as 70 hours by consuming the excretions before finally succumbing to exhaustion or refusing to consume any more of the contents, which invariably leads to death., Upon expiration of the handler, the bond with [     ] is broken and the object can once again be manipulated. In approximately 75% of test instances, [     ] will disappear once the bond is broken and reappear almost instantly on a nearby flat surface, seemingly with a preference for tables or shelves within the same room, and take on a new form. Approximately 90% of these reappearances of [     ] is within the general vicinity of the now deceased handler, but several times the object has been observed to reappear in nearby containment rooms, observation rooms, and in one case [DATA EXPUNGED]. Due to the catastrophic nature of that incident, extreme care is to be taken when in proximity to [     ]\u2019s containment or testing room. Foundation personnel are urged not to bring with them any beverages or containers within 100\u00a0m of [     ]\u2019s containment room even when the object is not actively being researched., [     ] was acquired by the Foundation from an underground bunker in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Germany, after the bunker\u2019s accidental discovery by construction workers.

Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, upon responding to the location, discovered several deceased and grossly emaciated corpses, both recent and some quite old.

Exploratory laparoscopy of [     ] shows the presence of internal structures resembling an incomplete set of bones, organs, and major blood vessels, composed of the same polymer. Small amounts of a black, volatile resin similar to plastination compounds leak from the eyes and damaged regions of the mannequin.

It demonstrates different behaviors depending on the genotypical sex and identified gender of nearby humans. These behavioral patterns are grouped as Pattern Z, Pattern Y, and Pattern X., Pattern Z behaviors occur when there is no human within 50 meters. [     ] remains inanimate and silent 99.5% of the time under these conditions. When animate, [     ] will dress in any available clothes, stand in front of any available full-length mirror, and return to an inanimate state, adopting a pose that showcases the outfit worn. It favors clothing which is designed for young women, and which leaves ample skin exposure. On rare occasions, [     ] will scratch short messages on nearby surfaces with a finger (or, depending on the state of repair, with an available appendage). Messages written since entering Foundation custody are found in Addendum 847-C., Pattern Y behaviors are adopted when there are male subjects but no female subjects within 50 meters, independent of intervening obstacles. Initial stage behaviors involve emitting vocalizations resembling high-pitched whimpering gasps2 and adopting more provocative poses. Occasional shudders can be observed during this time. After 3-5 minutes of the initial stage, [     ]'s behavior enters a secondary stage, during which it becomes fully animate, approaching any male subject, adopting a hunched pose and appearing to look up into the subject's eyes. Vocalizations during this period become more frequent and longer in duration. Subjects are able to handle and freely alter or pose [     ] during this time. When posed, it holds the new pose as balance allows. The final stage of Pattern Y behaviors occurs approximately 5 minutes after all subjects have left the 50-m perimeter of [     ]. It will then shatter select portions of its body and/or extract internal structures. Once shattering or extraction is complete, it emits sobbing vocalizations and returns to Pattern Z behaviors., Pattern X behaviors occur when any female subject approaches within 50 meters, independent of intervening obstacles, whether male subjects are present or not. [     ] will emit vocalizations resembling distressed grunts and screeches, immediately animate, and physically attack the woman. During Pattern X behaviors, [     ]'s strength and speed are greatly increased, with sprints of up to 45 kph and exertion of 40\u00a0kN of force having been measured. During an attack, [     ] will occasionally shatter an appendage (usually a finger or toe) in order to produce a sharp edge. Furthermore, plastination resin is released from its eyes, mouth, and shattered sections of its body. Resin falling in open wounds results in a quick hardening of soft tissues that spread until the victim's body reaches a composition of a similar polymer as [     ]. Following plastination, [     ] will harvest selected body parts from the victim corresponding to damaged sections of its own body. It will fuse these parts to its body via the resin. Not all damaged sections will be repaired in this way. Upon completion of harvesting, [     ] will return to Pattern Y or Pattern Z behaviors., The resin produced by [     ] has been shown to have its anomalous plastination effects occur only when applied to soft tissues of women. The resin has no effect on cadaverous, nonhuman, or male tissue. Application of high voltage electricity (in excess of 10\u00a0kV) will cause a temporary solidification of the resin, resulting in [     ] becoming inanimate for approximately 5 minutes, regardless of the behavior pattern expressed at the time., Addendum 847-A: Recovery Log, A federal human trafficking investigation led to the discovery of [     ] in the basement of an abandoned \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 department store in Las Vegas, NV on 8/23/1983, surrounded by partially disassembled and broken non-anomalous female mannequins wrapped in plastic sheets. FBI agents on the scene witnessed [     ] exhibit Pattern Y behaviors. Initially thinking it a trafficking victim, agents moved in to assist. [     ] then switched to Pattern X and attacked one of the agents. The agent subdued [     ] with her stun gun (leading to the discovery of high voltage electricity as a tool for containment) and was evacuated from the basement. The UIU was informed of the situation. Foundation agents were contacted through regular channels and [     ] was secured. Despite signs of human habitation, the trafficking victims were never found., Addendum 847-B: Shattering Event Log, Notable shattering events are listed below. Due to the shattering and harvesting behaviors of [     ], it has significantly altered appearance since entering Foundation custody. See photos in log for different stages of completion., "

        "text": " [     ] is the collective designation for an anomalous species of arthropod similar to Armadillidium vulgare, or the common pill bug. [     ] individuals are morphologically similar to A. vulgare in appearance, but can be distinguished visually by bright red striping patterns on their dorsal carapace. Visual identification is only possible by individuals not under the influence of [     ]\u2019s anomalous effects. [     ] is a parasitic organism which feeds on human mammary secretions. Access to this food source is gained by habitation and manipulation of deceased human infants., Affected persons are subject to a Type 3 cognitohazard via a pheromone vector, which repurposes the natural child-rearing instincts present in all humans for its own feeding and protection. Those subject to this effect are unable to perceive [     ] or the damage it causes to infants. Exposure to D-Class assets has determined that the effect does not apply to video or audio surveillance, and that Level 4 Biohazard precautions are sufficient in preventing the effects\u2019 onset. Personnel briefed on [     ]\u2019s effects show no special immunity to the false perceptions created by the anomaly., As of 14/07/2005, the Ethics Committee has determined that future human experimentation with [     ] will only be allowed in unique and dire circumstances. As such, all information regarding [     ]\u2019s relationship with humans and life cycle have been compiled from extensive surveillance and interviews conducted in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, the site of [     ]\u2019s discovery. Conclusions are based on an observational period from August 2003 through July 2005., Infestation begins when twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) instances of [     ] select an infant1 and access its crib. Observation has failed to detect any instance of [     ] prior to appearance within the target crib. Parents and D-Class personnel present will be unable to perceive [     ]. If any person passes within 0.5\u00a0m of the infant, [     ] instances will collectively release a fine spray, which causes immediate disorientation and rapid loss of consciousness., [     ] will then begin to burrow into the flesh of the sleeping infant. Favored points of entry include the mouth, eyes, anus, navel, and armpits. The infant will not react to the presence of [     ] in any fashion, suggesting the use of local anesthetics. Cardiopulmonary activity in the infant will cease within the first forty (40) minutes of this procedure, and within three (3) to five (5) hours, movement will resume, followed by strained vocalizations. At this point, the infant is considered an \u2018active colony\u2019 of [     ]. Incapacitated subjects will awaken soon after the first vocalization and investigate. Parents or other adults present within ear-shot will also show interest as per normal for distressed infant vocalization. If the original mother of the colony is present at this time, she will immediately begin breastfeeding regardless of previous feeding schedule or practices., Over roughly the next ten (10) weeks, parents and other adults begin to show increased affection and protectiveness toward the colony. During this stage, direct observation by present adults and children will be unable to detect any abnormalities in the colony\u2019s physiology, despite numerous dermal perforations and jerky, unnatural movement. The colony is capable of basic vocalization, and is able to emulate feeding, defecation, and play behaviors of normal infants with increasing proficiency. Decomposition is still visible via surveillance during this time, culminating in desiccation of the colony\u2019s remaining soft tissues2., By the end of the twelfth (12th) week, all observed colonies exhibited increased size, such that individual instances of [     ] are visible moving under the skin. Such colonies are considered \u2018mature\u2019, and individual instances will begin reproductive behavior during this period. During feeding, seven (7) to twelve (12) [     ] individuals will exit the colony through one of its dermal perforations, and take hold of any exposed portion of the host mother\u2019s skin for approximately 10 min before returning. Host mothers studied during this time begin to show increased progesterone production, as well as heightened levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, indicating an induced pregnancy. After an incubation period of two (2) to three (3) days, host mothers will \u2018birth\u2019 twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) instances of [     ] during her next sleep. Instances of [     ] have not been successfully tracked after birth. Maximum interval of dormancy before [     ] must initiate another infestation is unknown. After breeding behavior begins, the cycle will repeat once weekly for the duration of the infestation. No natural limit to [     ] infestation timeline has been observed. (See Addendum 400-02), Of \u2588\u2588\u2588 recorded infestations to date, all have occurred in the south-eastern United States in rural or mountainous areas, and in some cases have gone unnoticed for as long as nine (9) months. Improved detection and extermination of [     ] instances is considered a high research priority., Addendum 400-01: Interview 400-25, At this point in the interview, Mrs. B refused to answer any further questions, and exhibited increased emotional distress and separation anxiety. Post-interview medical examination revealed extensive ovarian/uterine trauma in excess of all other host mothers examined. Mrs. B was administered a Class A amnestic when observations were concluded, and is currently under Foundation surveillance as a Person of Interest., Addendum 400-02: As of 14/7/2010, [     ]-A and [     ]-B have been active in Foundation custody for five (5) years, indicating that colonies may be able to survive indefinitely if continually provided with food. Level 4 Bio-hazard precautions have successfully prevented not only reproduction of [     ], but also the spread of all cognitohazardous effects within Site-77. Limited access for experimentation may be granted with approval from the Ethics Committee and [     ]\u2019s HMCL supervisor (currently Dr. Grant). Please allow up to thirty (30) days for review prior to beginning any new line of experimentation., "

Its sides are made of translucent waxed paper and its interior framework provides a nested support for a circular glass cup measuring 6.5\u00a0cm in diameter and 10\u00a0cm in height. The anomalous properties of [     ] do not manifest unless both components are used together., When a candle is placed within [     ] and lit, the walls of [     ] depict the shadow of a miniature humanoid, as if lit from behind by the candle. The shadow on each side of the lantern depicts a different angle of the same subject. The shadow of the humanoid is always writhing, as if in pain, and it is surrounded by what appear to be semi-opaque flames. The shadow of the figure will persist as long as the candle is burning. Its motions become more frantic as the candle comes closer to burning out., All candle residue recovered from [     ] consists of rendered human fat, regardless of the original makeup of the candle. Damaged DNA samples have been recovered, but the identity of the source individual(s) has yet to be determined., "

        "text": " [     ] is a prototype Boeing \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588, designed by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and constructed in 16/06/1966 to specifications. Though superficially similar to the Boeing 737 which went into service shortly afterwards, [     ]'s model had various internal alterations, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite the various alterations, the most important feature of [     ] is the center left emergency door, which has been dubbed [     ]-1. [     ]-1 is a standard emergency door, though partially covered in extensive markings associated with Satanic cults adhering to [REDACTED]. [     ]-1 can be opened without major incident when grounded, and leads to the outside of the aircraft as expected. However, this is discouraged as nearly all personnel opening and/or passing through the door have reported severe anxiety problems and a persistent feeling of being watched., Long-term observation or exposure to [     ] is not recommended. Observation using any sort of electronic device is satisfactory while [     ] is grounded, though some visual anomalies have been recorded, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. As such, it is advised that personnel known to have a high tolerance to disturbing imagery be assigned to observation duty, and work no longer than three (3) consecutive days. All personnel involved in the repairs, observation, operation, or flight of [     ] must submit to psychological evaluations after each period of exposure., [     ]-1 will autonomously open once every thirty (30) days, and begin to close. This event can be considered the activation of [     ]-1. The speed at which [     ]-1 closes is highly dependent on [     ]'s altitude, velocity, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. It should be timed so that [     ]-1 opens in mid-flight, at an altitude of approximately 10,972\u00a0m and a speed of about 780\u00a0km/h. Failure to properly time this event is catastrophic, since [     ]-1 closing fully while grounded could affect all life-forms within an unknown radius, causing potentially hundreds of [DATA EXPUNGED], posing severe threats to population centers, and requiring immediate use of Procedure 600-Shoki. Please see [Document [     ] DE2] for further information on [DATA EXPUNGED] and effective means of termination., Once [     ]-1 spontaneously opens, cabin pressure will destabilize as expected, and extreme 'turbulence' is encountered. At various points during the flight, all present personnel may feel as if [     ] is quickly falling, though it has been ascertained that [     ] remains in relatively stable cruising conditions during all times, including during the times of these events. [     ]-1's opening may cause certain individuals present to suffer fatal heart-attacks or [DATA EXPUNGED]., Corpses with an undamaged larynx present within [     ] once [     ]-1 activates seemingly reanimate for the duration of the flight. The corpses remain largely immobile, and as such, pose no physical threat, but are capable of speech. These speaking corpses should be terminated if possible, as their speech poses potential psychological dangers, as well as enable [     ]-1's closing via [DATA EXPUNGED]. The language spoken by these reanimated corpses remains unidentified., Addendum 616-01: The airliner series never went into service, as the various anomalous events surrounding [     ]'s test flights were reported as various design failures. All plans and blue-prints have been seized by the Foundation. It is now believed \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's designs were entirely intentional and done under no external compulsion. Recovered documents from the construction process describe [DATA EXPUNGED]., Addendum 616-02: On \u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, A remote controlled rover obtained footage from within [     ]-1. All personnel who viewed this footage directly committed suicide by various means within a two-month period. A security tape of the video with the recording playing did not cause any death, despite containing full sound and color recordings of the footage. It displayed a video of a small child violently being [DATA EXPUNGED] within a dark red room. All further attempts to observe past the \"event horizon\" have yielded similar results, and such expeditions are no longer permitted., Addendum 616-03: Interview logs pertaining to [     ] are available in document Interview 616-AM., "

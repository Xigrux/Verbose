While [     ] is generally cordial and cooperative with Foundation staff, it can become especially irritated or at times outright aggressive if it feels that it is in the presence of what it calls the \"Pestilence\". Although the exact nature of this Pestilence is currently unknown to Foundation researchers, it does seem to be an issue of immense concern to [     ]., [     ] will become hostile with individuals it sees as being affected by the Pestilence, often having to be restrained should it encounter such.

This continued for a period of several months, during which [     ] never exhibited any aggressive behaviours., On April 16th, 2017, as Dr. Hamm was entering [     ]'s test chamber to conduct another routine interview, the entity began to grow anxious and asked Dr. Hamm if he was feeling well. Following protocol, Dr. Hamm reminded [     ] that the interview was required, after which the entity became hostile and attacked Dr. Hamm, killing him.

Adults range in size from 1.5 to 3\u00a0m (5 to 10 ft) in height, and weigh between 90 and 270\u00a0kg (200 - 600 lbs). They have grey, brown, black, red, and occasionally white fur. They possess large eyes with good vision, a pronounced brow ridge, and a sagittal crest on the forehead similar to that of the gorilla, but present in both sexes. Their intelligence is on par with that of Pan troglodytes (the common chimpanzee)., [     ] evolved alongside Homo sapiens, existing contemporaneously with proto-humans and humans in large numbers until 10,000-15,000 years ago, when an extinction event eliminated all but 1-5% of their population. This event was triggered by [     ] contracting an anomalous \"pseudo-disease\" classified as [     ]-f1. This disease is passed on at the genetic level and affects every present-day instance of [     ]. The majority of [     ] instances are born immune to the effect; those who are not born immune quickly die., The effect of [     ]-f1 is as follows: Any hominid (including humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and non-immune instances of [     ]) that directly or indirectly observes any instance of [     ] has a minimum 2% chance of being instantly killed through anomalous means via permanent cessation of brain function. This percentage is cumulative, and the longer a human views [     ], the higher the chance of instantaneous death increases, at a rate of +1% chance per 20 minutes of viewing. This effect varies between individual members of [     ]'s species, with some individuals carrying a 'death chance' of 90%. The effect is also produced by dead individuals, though small fur samples do not exhibit the effect., Known means of preventing this effect are small-scale only and include [REDACTED] (see attached documentation; Level 3 clearance required)., Because of [     ]'s close relation to humanity, it is considered likely that [     ]-f1 could eventually transfer to human carriers. Any instance of [     ] finding its way to a major population center could constitute an \u2588\u2588-class end of the world scenario with a minimum death toll of [REDACTED] and possible extinction of humanity.
